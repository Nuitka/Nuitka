Nuitka Release 0.6.0 (Draft)
=============================

This release is not done yet.


Nuitka Release 0.5.33
=====================

This release contains a bunch of fixes, most of which were previously released
as part of hotfixes, and important new optimization for generators.

Bug Fixes
---------

- Fix, nested functions with local classes using outside function closure
  variables were not registering their usage, which could lead to errors
  at C compile time. Fixed in 0.5.32.1 already.

- Fix, usage of built-in calls in a class level could crash the compiler if
  a class variable was updated with its result. Fixed in 0.5.32.1 already.

- Python 3.7: The handling of non-type bases classes was not fully compatible
  and wrong usages were giving ``AttributeError`` instead of ``TypeError``.
  Fixed in 0.5.32.2 already.

- Python 3.5: Fix, ``await`` expressions didn't annotate their exception exit.
  Fixed in 0.5.32.2 already.

- Python3: The ``enum`` module usages with ``__new__`` in derived classes
  were not working, due to our automatic ``staticmethod`` decoration. Turns
  out, that was only needed for Python2 and can be removed, making enum work
  all the way. Fixed in 0.5.32.3 already.

- Fix, recursion into ``__main__`` was done and could lead to compiler crashes
  if the main module was named like that. This is not prevented. Fixed in
  0.5.32.3 already.

- Python3: The name for list contraction's frames was wrong all along and not
  just changed for 3.7, so drop that version check on it. Fixed in 0.5.32.3
  already.

- Fix, the hashing of code objects has creating a key that could produce more
  overlaps for the hash than necessary. Using a ``C1`` on line 29 and ``C`` on
  line 129, was considered the same. And that is what actually happened. Fixed
  in 0.5.32.3 already.

- MacOS: Various fixes for newer Xcode versions to work as well. Fixed in
  0.5.32.4 already.

- Python3: Fix, the default ``__annotations__`` was the empty dict and could
  be modified, leading to severe corruption potentially. Fixed in 0.5.32.4
  already.

- Python3: When an exception is thrown into a generator that currently does
  a ``yield from`` is not to be normalized.

- Python3: Some exception handling cases of ``yield from`` were leaking
  references to objects. Fixed in 0.5.32.5 already.

- Python3: Nested namespace packages were not working unless the directory
  continued to exist on disk. Fixed in 0.5.32.5 already.

- Standalone: Do not include ``icuuc.dll`` which is a system DLL. Fixed in
  0.5.32.5 already.

- Standalone: Added hidden dependency of newer version of ``sip``. Fixed in
  0.5.32.5 already.

- Standalone: Do not copy file permissions of DLLs and extension modules as
  that makes deleting and modifying them only harder. Fixed in 0.5.32.6
  already.

- Windows: The multiprocessing plugin was not always properly patching
  the run time for all module loads, made it more robust. Fixed in
  0.5.32.6 already.

- Standalone: Do not preserve permissions of copied DLLs, which can cause
  issues with read-only files on Windows when later trying to overwrite or
  remove files.

- Python3.4: Make sure to disconnect finished generators from their frames
  to avoid potential data corruption. Fixed in 0.5.32.6 already.

- Python3.5: Make sure to disconnect finished coroutines from their frames
  to avoid potential data corruption. Fixed in 0.5.32.6 already.

- Python3.6: Make sure to disconnect finished asyncgen from their frames
  to avoid potential data corruption. Fixed in 0.5.32.6 already.

- Python3.5: Explicit frame closes of frames owned by coroutines could
  corrupt data. Fixed in 0.5.32.7 already.

- Python3.6: Explicit frame closes of frames owned by asyncgen could
  corrupt data. Fixed in 0.5.32.7 already.

- Python 3.4: Fix threaded imports by properly handling ``_initializing``
  in compiled modules ```spec`` attributes. Before it happen that another
  thread attempts to use an unfinished module. Fixed in 0.5.32.8 already.

- Fix, the options ``--include-module`` and ``--include-package`` were
  present but not visible in the help output. Fixed in 0.5.32.8 already.

- Windows: The multiprocessing plugin failed to properly pass compiled
  functions. Fixed in 0.5.32.8 already.

- Python3: Fix, optimization for in-place operations on mapping values
  are not allowed and had to be disabled. Fixed in 0.5.32.8 already.

- Python 3.5: Fixed exception handling with coroutines and asyncgen ``throw``
  to not corrupt exception objects.

- Python 3.7: Added more checks to class creations that were missing for
  full compatibility.

- Python3: Smarter hashing of unicode values avoids increased memory usage
  from cached converted forms in debug mode.

Organizational
--------------

- The issue tracker on Github is now the one that should be used with Nuitka,
  winning due to easier issue templating and integration with pull requests.

- Document the threading model and exception model to use for MinGW64.

- Removed the ``enum`` plug-in which is no longer useful after the improvements
  to the ``staticmethod`` handling for Python3.

- Added Python 3.7 testing for Travis.

- Make it clear in the documentation that ``pyenv`` is not supported.

- The version output includes more information now, OS and architecture, so
  issue reports should contain that now.

- On PyPI we didn't yet indicated Python 3.7 as supported, which it of course
  is.

New Features
------------

- Added support for MiniConda Python.

Optimization
------------

- Using goto based generators that return from execution and resume based on
  heap storage. This makes tests using generators twice as fast and they no
  longer use a full C stack of 2MB, but only 1K instead.

- Conditional ``a if cond else b``, ``a and b```, ``a or b`` expressions of
  which the result value is are now transformed into conditional statements
  allowing to apply further optimizations to the right and left side
  expressions as well.

- Replace unused function creations with side effects from their default
  values with just those, removing more unused code.

- Put all statement related code and declarations for it in a dedicated C
  block, making things slightly more easy for the C compiler to re-use the
  stack space.

- Avoid linking against ``libpython`` in module mode on everything but Windows
  where it is really needed. No longer check for static Python, not needed
  anymore.

- More compact function, generator, and asyncgen creation code for the normal
  cases, avoid qualname if identical to name for all of them.

- Python2 class dictionaries are now indeed directly optimized, giving more
  compact code.

- Module exception exits and thus its frames have become optional allowing to
  avoid some code for some special modules.

- Uncompiled generator integration was backported to 3.4 as well, improving
  compatibility and speed there as well.

Cleanups
--------

- Frame object and their cache declarations are now handled by the way of
  allocated variable descriptions, avoid special handling for them.

- The interface to "forget" a temporary variable has been replaced with a new
  method that skips a number for it. This is done to keep expression use the
  same indexes for all their child expressions, but this is more explicit.

- Instead of passing around C variables names for temporary values, we now
  have full descriptions, with C type, code name, storage location, and the
  init value to use. This makes the information more immediately available
  where it is needed.

- Variable declarations are now created when needed and stored in dedicated
  variable storage objects, which then in can generate the code as necessary.

- Module code generation has been enhanced to be closer to the pattern used
  by functions, generators, etc.

- There is now only one spot that creates variable declaration, instead of
  previous code duplications.

- Code objects are now attached to functions, generators, coroutines, and
  asyncgen bodies, and not anymore to the creation of these objects. This
  allows for simpler code generation.

- Removed fiber implementations, no more needed.

Tests
-----

- Finally the asyncgen tests can be enabled in the CPython 3.6 test suite as
  the corrupting crasher has been identified.

- Cover ever more cases of spurious permission problems on Windows.

- Added the ability to specify specific modules a comparison test should
  recurse to, making some CPython tests follow into modules where actual
  test code lives.

Summary
-------

This release is huge in many ways.

First, finishing "goto generators" clears an old scalability problem of Nuitka
that needed to be addressed. No more do generators/coroutines/asyncgen consume
too much memory, but instead they become as lightweight as they ought to be.

Second, the use of variable declarations carying type information all through
the code generation, is an important pre-condition for "C types" work to resume
and become possible, what will be 0.6.0 and the next release.

Third, the improved generator performance will be removing a lot of cases,
where Nuitka wasn't as fast, as its current state not using "C types" yet,
should allow. It is now consistenly faster than CPython for everything
related to generators.

Fourth, the fibers were a burden for the debugging and linking of Nuitka on
various platforms, as they provided deprecated interfaces or not. As they are
now gone, Nuitka ought to definitely work on any platform where Python works.

From here on, C types work can take it, and produce the results we are waiting
for in the next major release cycle that is about to start.

Also the amount of fixes for this release has been incredibly high. Lots of
old bugs esp. for coroutines and asyncgen have been fixed, this is not only
faster, but way more correct. Mainly due to the easier debugging and interface
to the context code, bugs were far easier to avoid and/or find.


Nuitka Release 0.5.32
=====================

This release contains substantial new optimization, bug fixes, and already the
full support for Python 3.7. Among the fixes, the enhanced coroutine work for
compatiblity with uncompiled ones is most important.

Bug Fixes
---------

- Fix, was optimizing write backs of attribute in-place assignments falsely.

- Fix, generator stop future was not properly supported. It is now the default
  for Python 3.7 which showed some of the flaws.

- Python3.5: The ``__qualname__`` of coroutines and asyncgen was wrong.

- Python3.5: Fix, for dictionary unpackings to calls, check the keys if they
  are string values, and raise an exception if not.

- Python3.6: Fix, need to check assignment unpacking for too short sequences,
  we were giving ``IndexError`` instead of ``ValueError`` for these. Also
  the error messages need to consider if they should refer to "at least" in
  their wording.

- Fix, outline nodes were cloned more than necessary, which would corrupt the
  code generation if they later got removed, leading to a crash.

- Python3.5: Compiled coroutines awaiting uncompiled coroutines was not working
  properly for finishing the uncompiled ones. Also the other way around was
  raising a ``RuntimeError`` when trying to pass an exception to them when they
  were already finished. This should resolve issues with ``asyncio`` module.

- Fix, side effects of a detected exception raise, when they had an exception
  detected inside of them, lead to an infinite loop in optimization. They are
  now optimized in-place, avoiding an extra step later on.

New Features
------------

- Support for Python 3.7 with only some corner cases not supported yet.

Optimization
------------

- Delay creation of ``StopIteration`` exception in generator code for as long
  as possible. This gives more compact code for generations, which now pass
  the return values via compiled generator attribute for Python 3.3 or higher.

- Python3: More immediate re-formulation of classes with no bases. Avoids noise
  during optimization.

- Python2: For class dictionaries that are only assigned from values without
  side effects, they are not converted to temporary variable usages, allowing
  the normal SSA based optimization to work on them. This leads to constant
  values for class dictionaries of simple classes.

- Explicit cleanup of nodes, variables, and local scopes that become unused,
  has been added, allowing for breaking of cyclic dependencies that prevented
  memory release.

Tests
-----

- Adapted 3.5 tests to work with 3.7 coroutine changes.

- Added CPython 3.7 test suite.

Cleanups
--------

- Removed remaining code that was there for 3.2 support. All uses of version
  comparisons with 3.2 have been adapted. For us, Python3 now means 3.3, and
  we will not work with 3.2 at all. This removed a fair bit of complexity for
  some things, but not all that much.

- Have dedicated file for import released helpers, so they are easier to find
  if necessary. Also do not have code for importing a name in the header file
  anymore, not performance relevant.

- Disable Python warnings when running scons. These are particularily given
  when using a Python debug binary, which is happening when Nuitka is run with
  ``--python-debug`` option and the inline copy of Scons is used.

- Have a factory function for all conditional statement nodes created. This
  solved a TODO and handles the creation of statement sequences for the branches
  as necessary.

- Split class reformulation into two files, one for Python2 and one for Python3
  variant. They share no code really, and are too confusing in a single file,
  for the huge code bodies.

- Locals scopes now have a registry, where functions and classes register their
  locals type, and then it is created from that.

- Have a dedicated helper function for single argument calls in static code
  that does not require an array of objects as an argument.

Organizational
--------------

- There are now ``requirements-devel.txt`` and ``requirements.txt`` files aimed
  at usage with scons and by users, but they are not used in installation.

Summary
-------

This releases has this important step to add conversion of locals dictionary
usages to temporary variables. It is not yet done everywhere it is possible,
and the resulting temporary variables are not yet propagated in the all the
cases, where it clearly is possible. Upcoming releases ought to achieve that
most Python2 classes will become to use a direct dictionary creation.

Adding support for Python 3.7 is of course also a huge step. And also this
happened fairly quickly and soon after its release. The generic classes it
adds were the only real major new feature. It breaking the internals for
exception handling was what was holding back initially, but past that, it
was really easy.

Expect more optimization to come in the next releases, aiming at both the
ability to predict Python3 metaclasses ``__prepare__`` results, and at more
optimization applied to variables after they became temporary variables.


Nuitka Release 0.5.31
=====================

This release is massive in terms of fixes, but also adds a lot of refinement
to code generation, and more importantly adds experimental support for
Python 3.7, while enhancing support for Pyt5 in standalone mode by a lot.

Bug Fixes
---------

- Standalone: Added missing dependencies for ``PyQt5.Qt`` module.

- Plugins: Added support for ``PyQt5.Qt`` module and its ``qml`` plugins.

- Plugins: The sensible plugin list for PyQt now includes that platforms
  plugins on Windows too, as they are kind of mandatory.

- Python3: Fix, for uninstalled Python versions wheels that linked against
  the ``Python3`` library as opposed to ``Python3X``, it was not found.

- Standalone: Prefer DLLs used by main program binary over ones used by
  wheels.

- Standalone: For DLLs added by Nuitka plugins, add the package directory
  to the search path for dependencies where they might live.

- Fix, the ``vars`` built-in didn't annotate its exception exit.

- Python3: Fix, the ``bytes`` and ``complex`` built-ins needs to be treated as
  a slot too.

- Fix, consider if ``del`` variable must be assigned, in which case no
  exception exit should be created. This prevented ``Tkinter`` compilation.

- Python3.6: Added support for the following language construct:

  .. code-block:: python

    d = {"metaclass" : M}

    class C(**d):
       pass

- Python3.5: Added support for cyclic imports. Now a ``from`` import with
  a name can really cause an import to happen, not just a module attribute
  lookup.

- Fix, ``hasattr`` was never raising exceptions.

- Fix, ``bytearray`` constant values were considered to be non-iterable.

- Python3.6: Fix, now it is possible to ``del __annotations__`` in a class
  and behave compatible. Previously in this case we were falling back to the
  module variable for annotations used after that which is wrong.

- Fix, some built-in type conversions are allowed to return derived types,
  but Nuitka assumed the excact type, this affected ``bytes``, ``int``,
  ``long``, ``unicode``.

- Standalone: Fix, the ``_socket`` module was insisted on to be found, but
  can be compiled in.

New Features
------------

- Added experimental support for Python 3.7, more work will be needed
  though for full support. Basic tests are working, but there are are
  at least more coroutine changes to follow.

- Added support for building extension modules against statically linked
  Python. This aims at supporting manylinux containers, which are supposed
  to be used for creating widely usable binary wheels for Linux. Programs
  won't work with statically linked Python though.

- Added options to allow ignoring the Windows cache for DLL dependencies or
  force an update.

- Allow passing options from distutils to Nuitka compilation via setup
  options.

- Added option to disable the DLL dependency cache on Windows as it may
  become wrong after installing new software.

- Added experimental ability to provide extra options for Nuitka to setuptools.

- Python3: Remove frame preservation and restoration of exceptions. This is
  not needed, but leaked over from Python2 code.

Optimization
------------

- Apply value tracing to local dict variables too, enhancing the optimization
  for class bodies and function with ``exec`` statements by a lot.

- Better optimization for "must not have value", wasn't considering merge
  traces of uninitialized values, for which this is also the case.

- Use 10% less memory at compile time due to specialized base classes for
  statements with a single child only allowing ``__slots__`` usage by not
  having multiple inheritance for those.

- More immediately optimize branches with known truth values, so that merges
  are avoided and do not prevent trace based optimization before the pass after
  the next one. In some cases, optimization based on traces could fail to be
  done if there was no next pass caused by other things.

- Much faster handling for functions with a lot of ``eval`` and ``exec`` calls.

- Static optimization of ``type`` with known type shapes, the value is predicted
  at compile time.

- Optimize containers for all compile time constants into constant nodes. This
  also enables further compile time checks using them, e.g. with ``isinstance``
  or ``in`` checks.

- Standalone: Using threads when determining DLL dependencies. This will speed
  up the un-cached case on Windows by a fair bit.

- Also remove unused assignments for mutable constant values.

- Python3: Also optimize calls to ``bytes`` built-in, this was so far not done.

- Statically optimize iteration over constant values that are not iterable
  into errors.

- Removed Fortran, Java, LaTex, PDF, etc. stuff from the inline copies of
  Scons for faster startup and leaner code. Also updated to 3.0.1 which is
  no important difference over 3.0.0 for Nuitka however.

- Make sure to always release temporary objects before checking for error
  exits. When done the other way around, more C code than necessary will
  be created, releasing them in both normal case and error case after the
  check.

- Also remove unused assignments in case the value is a mutable constant.

Cleanups
--------

- Don't store "version" numbers of variable traces for code generation, instead
  directly use the references to the value traces instead, avoiding later
  lookups.

- Added dedicated module for ``complex`` built-in nodes.

- Moved C helpers for integer and complex types to dedicated files, solving the
  TODOs around them.

- Removed some Python 3.2 only codes.

Organizational
--------------

- For better bug reports, the ``--version`` output now contains also the Python
  version information and the binary path being used.

- Started using specialized exceptions for some types of errors, which will
  output the involved data for better debugging without having to reproduce
  anything. This does e.g. output XML dumps of problematic nodes.

- When encountering a problem (compiler crash) in optimization, output the
  source code line that is causing the issue.

- Added support for Fedora 28 RPM builds.

- Remove more instances of mentions of 3.2 as supported or usable.

- Renovated the graphing code and made it more useful.

Summary
-------

This release marks important progress, as the locals dictionary tracing is
a huge step ahead in terms of correctness and proper optimization. The actual
resulting dictionary is not yet optimized, but that ought to follow soon now.

The initial support of 3.7 is important. Right now it apparently works pretty
well as a 3.6 replacement already, but definitely a lot more work will be
needed to fully catch up.

For standalone, this accumulated a lot of improvements related to the plugin
side of Nuitka. Thanks to those involved in making this better. On Windows
things ought to be much faster now, due to parallel usage of dependency
walker.


Nuitka Release 0.5.30
=====================

This release has improvements in all areas. Many bug fixes are accompanied
with optimization changes towards value tracing.

Bug Fixes
---------

- Fix, the new setuptools runners were not used by ``pip`` breaking the use
  of Nuitka from PyPI.

- Fix, imports of ``six.moves`` could crash the compiler for built-in names.
  Fixed in 0.5.29.2 already.

- Windows: Make the ``nuitka-run`` not a symlink as these work really bad on
  that platform, instead make it a full copy just like we did for ``nuitka3-run``
  already. Fixed in 0.5.29.2 already.

- Python3.5: In module mode, ``types.coroutine`` was monkey patched into an
  endless recursion if including more than one module, e.g. for a package.
  Fixed in 0.5.29.3 already.

- Python3.5: Dictionary unpackings with both star arguments and non star
  arguments could leak memory. Fixed in 0.5.29.3 already.

  .. code-block:: python

    c = {a : 1, **d}

- Fix, distutils usage was not working for Python2 anymore, due to using
  ``super`` for what are old style classes on that version.

- Fix, some method calls to C function members could leak references.

  .. code-block:: python

    class C:
       for_call = functools.partial

       def m():
          self.for_call() # This leaked a reference to the descriptor.

- Python3.5: The bases classes should be treated as an unpacking too.

  .. code-block:: python

    class C(*D): # Allowed syntax that was not supported.
       pass

- Windows: Added back batch files to run Nuitka from the command line. Fixed
  in 0.5.29.5 already.

New Features
------------

- Added option ``--include-package`` to force inclusion of a whole package with
  the submodules in a compilation result.

- Added options ``--include-module`` to force inclusion of a single module in
  a compilation result.

- The ```multiprocessing`` plug-in got adapted to Python 3.4 changes and will
  now also work in accelerated mode on Windows.

- It is now possible to specify the Qt plugin directories with e.g.
  ``--enable-plugin=qt_plugins=imageformats`` and have only those included. This
  should avoid dependency creep for shared libraries.

- Plugins can now make the decision about recursing to a module or not.

- Plugins now can get their own options passed.

Optimization
------------

- The re-raising of exceptions has gotten its own special node type. This aims
  at more readability (XML output) and avoiding the overhead of checking
  potential attributes during optimization.

- Changed built-in ``int``, ``long``, and ``float`` to using a slot mechanism
  that also analyses the type shape and detects and warns about errors at
  compile time.

- Changed the variable tracing to value tracing. This meant to cleanup all the
  places that were using it to find the variable.

- Enable must have / must not value value optimization for all kinds of variables
  including module and closure variables. This often avoids error exits and leads
  to smaller and faster generated code.

Tests
-----

- Added burn test with local install of pip distribution to virtualenv before
  making any PyPI upload. It seems pip got its specific error sources too.

- Avoid calling ``2to3`` and prefer ``<python> -m lib2to3`` instead, as it
  seems at least Debian Testing stopped to provide the binary by default. For
  Python 2.6 and 3.2 we continue to rely on it, as the don't support that mode
  of operation.

- The PyLint checks have been made more robust and even more Python3 portable.

- Added PyLint to Travis builds, so PRs are automatically checked too.

- Added test for distutils usage with Nuitka that should prevent regressions
  for this new feature and to document how it can be used.

- Make coverage taking work on Windows and provide the full information needed,
  the rendering stage is not there working yet though.

- Expanded the trick assignment test cases to cover more slots to find bugs
  introduced with more aggressive optimization of closure variables.

- New test to cover multiprocessing usage.

- Generating more code tests out of doctests for increased coverage of
  Nuitka.

Cleanups
--------

- Stop using ``--python-version`` in tests where they still remained.

- Split the forms of ``int`` and ``long`` into two different nodes, they share
  nothing except the name. Create the constants for the zero arg variant more
  immediately.

- Split the output comparison part into a dedicated testing module so it can
  be re-used, e.g. when doing distutils tests.

- Removed dead code from variable closure taking.

- Have a dedicated module for the metaclass of nodes in the tree, so it
  is easier to find, and doesn't clutter the node base classes module as
  much.

- Have a dedicated node for reraise statements instead of checking for
  all the arguments to be non-present.

Organizational
--------------

- There is now a pull request template for Github when used.

- Deprecating the ``--python-version`` argument which should be replaced by
  using ``-m nuitka`` with the correct Python version. Outputs have been
  updated to recommend this one instead.

- Make automatic import sorting and autoformat tools properly executable on
  Windows without them changing new lines.

- The documentation was updated to prefer the call method with ``-m nuitka``
  and manually providing the Python binary to use.

Summary
-------

This release continued the distutils integration adding first tests, but more
features and documentation will be needed.

Also, for the locals dictionary work, the variable tracing was made generic,
but not yet put to use. If we use this to also trace dictionary keys, we can
expect a lot of improvements for class code again.

The locals dictionary tracing will be the focus before resuming the work on
C types, where the ultimate performance boost lies. However, currently, not
the full compatibility has been achieved even with currently using dictionaries
for classes, and we would like to be able to statically optimize those better
anyway.


Nuitka Release 0.5.29
=====================

This release comes with a lot of improvements across the board. A lot of focus
has been givevn to the packaging side of Nuitka, but also there is a lot of
compatibility work.

Bug Fixes
---------

- Windows: When using Scons for Python3 and Scons for Python2 on the same
  build directory, a warning would be given about the need to migrate. Make
  the Scons cache directory use the Python ABI version as a key too, to
  avoid these issues. Fixed in 0.5.28.1 already.

- Windows: Fixup for Python3 and Scons no more generating the MinGW64 import
  library for Python anymore properly. Was only working if cached from a
  previous install of Nuitka. Fixed in 0.5.28.1 already.

- Plugins: Made the data files plugin mandatory and added support for the
  scrapy package needs.

- Fix, added implicit dependencies for ``pkg_resources.external`` package.
  Fixed in 0.5.28.1 already.

- Fix, an import of ``x.y`` where this was not a package didn't cause the
  package ``x`` to be included.

* Standalone: Added support for ``six.moves`` and ``requests.packages`` meta
  imports, these cause hidden implicit imports, that are now properly handled.

- Standalone: Patch the ``__file__`` value for technical bytecode modules
  loaded during Python library initialization in a more compatible way.

- Standalone: Extension modules when loaded might actually raise legit
  errors, e.g. ``ImportError`` of another module, don't make those into
  ``SystemError`` anymore.

- Python3.2: The ``__package__`` of sub-packages was wrong, which could cause
  issues when doing relative imports in that sub-package.

- Python3: Contractions in a finally clause could crash the compiler.

- Fix, unused closure variables could lead to a crash in they were passed to
  a nested function.

- Linux: Standalone dependency analysis could enter an endless recursion in
  case of cyclic dependencies.

- Python3.6: Async generation expressions need to return a ``None`` value too.

- Python3.4: Fix, ``__spec__`` is a package attribute and not a built-in
  value.

New Features
------------

- It is now possible to run Nuitka with ``some_python_you_choose -m nuitka ...``
  and therefore know exactly which Python installation is going to be used. It
  does of course need Nuitka installed for this to work. This mechanism is going
  to replace the ``--python-version`` mechanism in the future.

- There are dedicated runners for Python3, simply use ``nuitka3`` or
  ``nuitka3-run`` to execute Nuitka if your code is Python3 code.

- Added warning for implicit exception raises due to mismatch in unpacking
  length. These are statically detected, but so far were not warned about.

- Added cache for ``depends.exe`` results. This speeds up standalone mode
  again as some of these calls were really slow.

- The import tracer is more robust against recursion and works with Python3
  now.

- Added an option to assume yes for downloading questions. The currently only
  enables the download of ``depends.exe`` and is intended for CI servers.

- There is now a report file for scons, which records the values used to run
  things, this could be useful for debugging.

- Nuitka now registers with distutils and can be used with ``bdist_wheel``
  directly, but this lacks documentation and tests. Many improvements in
  the distutils build.

Optimization
------------

- Forward propagate compile time constants even if they are only potential
  usages. This is actually the case where this makes the most sense, as it
  might remove its use entirely from the branches that do not use it.

- Avoid extra copy of ``finally`` code. The cloning operation takes time and
  memory, and this shaved of 0.3% of Nuitka memory usage, as these can also
  become dangling.

- Class dictionaries are now proper dictionarties in optimization, using some
  dedicated code for name lookups that are transformed to dedicated locals
  dictionary or mapping (Python3) accesses. This currently does not fully
  optimize, but will in coming releases, and saves about 25% of memory compared
  to the old code.

- Treating module attributes ``__package__``, ``__loader__``, ``__file__``,
  and ``__spec__`` with dedicated nodes, that allow or forbid optimization
  dependent on usage.

- Python3.6: Async generator expressions were not working fully, become more
  compatible.

- Fix, using ``super`` inside a contraction could crash the compiler.

- Fix, also accept ``__new__`` as properly decorated in case it's a
  ``classmethod`` too.

- Fix, removed obsolete ``--nofreeze-stdlib`` which only complicated using
  the ``--recurse-stdlib`` which should be used instead.

Organizational
--------------

- The ``nuitka`` Python package is now installed into the public namespace and
  used from there. There are distinct copies to be installed for both Python2
  and Python3 on platforms where it is supported.

- Using ``twine`` for upload to PyPI now as recommended on their site.

- Running ``pylint`` on Windows became practical again.

- Added RPM packages for Fedora 26 and 27, these used to fail due to packaging
  issues.

- Added RPM packages for openSUSE Leap 42.2, 42.3 and 15.0 which were simply
  missing.

- Added RPM packages for SLE 15.

- Added support for PyLint 1.8 and its new warnings.

- The RPM packages no longer contain ``nuitka-run3``, it will be replaced by
  the new ``nuitka3-run`` which is in all packages.

- The runners used for installation are now easy install created, but patched
  to avoid overhead at run time.

- Added repository for Ubuntu Artful (17.10) for download, removed support
  for Ubuntu Yakkety, Vivid and Zesty (no more supported by them).

- Removed support for Debian Wheezy and Ubuntu Precise (they are too old for
  modern packaging used).

- There is now a issue template for Github when used.

Tests
-----

- Windows: Standalone tests were referencing an old path to ``depends.exe``
  that wasn't populated on new installs.

- Refinements for CPython test suites to become more stable in results. Some
  tests occasionally fail to clean up, or might do indetermistic outputs, or
  are not relevant at all.

- The tests don't use the runners, but more often do ``-m nuitka`` to become
  executable without having to find the proper runner. This improves usage
  during the RPM builds and generally.

- Travis: Do not test development versions of CPython, even for stable release,
  they break too often.

Summary
-------

This release consolidates a lot of what we already had, adding hopeful stuff
for distutils integration. This will need tests and documentation though, but
should make Nuitka really easy to use. A few features are still missing to make
it generally reliable in that mode, but they are going to come.

Also the locals dictionary work is kind of incomplete without a proper generic
tracing of not only local variables, but also dictionary keys. With that work
in place, a lot of improvements will happen.


Nuitka Release 0.5.28
=====================

This release has a focus on compatibility work and contains bug fixes and
work to enhance the usability of Nuitka by integrating with distutils. The
major improvement is that contractions no longer use pseudo functions to
achieve their own local scope, but that there is now a dedicated structure
for that representing an in-lined function.

Bug Fixes
---------

- Python3.6: Fix, ``async for`` was not yet implemented for async generators.

- Fix, functions with keyword arguments where the value was determined to be
  a static raise could crash the compiler.

- Detect using MinGW64 32 bits C compiler being used with 64 bits Python
  with better error message.

- Fix, when extracting side effects of a static raise, extract them more
  recursively to catch expressions that themselves have no code generation
  being used. This fixes at least static raises in keyword arguments of a
  function call.

- Compatibility: Added support for proper operation of ```pkgutil.get_data``
  by implementing ``get_data`` in our meta path based loader.

- Compatibility: Added ``__spec__`` module attribute was previously missing,
  present on Python3.4 and higher.

- Compatibility: Made ``__loader__`` module attribute set when the module is
  loading already.

- Standalone: Resolve the ``@rpath`` and ``@loader_path`` from ``otool`` on
  MacOS manually to actual paths, which adds support for libraries compiled
  with that.

- Fix, nested functions calling ``super`` could crash the compiler.

- Fix, could not use ``--recurse-directory`` with arguments that had a
  trailing slash.

- Fix, using ``--recurse-directory`` on packages that are not in the search
  crashed the compiler.

- Compatibility: Python2 ``set`` and ``dict`` contractions were using extra
  frames like Python3 does, but those are not needed.

- Standalone: Fix, the way ``PYTHONHOME`` was set on Windows had no effect,
  which allowed the compiled binary to access the original installation still.

- Standalone: Added some newly discovered missing hidden dependencies of
  extension modules.

- Compatiblity: The name mangling of private names (e.g. ``__var``) in classes
  was applied to variable names, and function declarations, but not to classes
  yet.

- Python3.6: Fix, added support for list contractions with ``await`` expressions
  in async generators.

- Python3.6: Fix, ``async for`` was not working in async generators yet.

- Fix, for module tracebacks, we output the module name ``<module name``>
  instead of merely ``<module>``, but if the module was in a package, that
  was not indicated. Now it is ``<module package.name>``.

- Windows: The cache directory could be unicode which then failed to pass as
  an argument to scons. We now encode such names as UTF-8 and decode in Scons
  afterwards, solving the problem in a generic way.

- Standalone: Need to recursively resolve shared libraries with ``ldd``,
  otherwise not all could be included.

- Standalone: Make sure ``sys.path`` has no references to CPython compile time
  paths, or else things may work on the compiling machine, but not on another.

- Standalone: Added various missing dependencies.

- Standalone: Wasn't considering the DLLs directory for standard library
  extensions for freezing, which would leave out these.

- Compatibility: For ``__future__`` imports the ``__import__`` function was
  called more than once.

Optimization
------------

- Contractions are now all properly inlined and allow for optimization as if
  they were fully local. This should give better code in some cases.

- Classes are now all building their locals dictionary inline to the using
  scope, allowing for more compact code.

- The dictionary API was not used in module template code, although it helps
  to generate more compact code.

New Features
------------

- Experimental support for building platform dependent wheel distribution.

  .. code-block:: sh

     python setup.py --command-packages=nuitka.distutils clean -a bdist_nuitka

  Use with caution, this is incomplete work.

- Experimental support for running tests against compiled installation with
  ``nose`` and ``py.test``.

- When specifiying what to recurse to, now patterns can be used, e.g. like
  this ``--recurse-not-to=*.tests`` which will skip all tests in submodules
  from compilation.

- By setting ``NUITKA_PACKAGE_packagename=/some/path`` the ``__path__`` of
  packages can be extended automatically in order to allow and load uncompiled
  sources from another location. This can be e.g. a ``tests`` sub-package or
  other plug-ins.

- By default when creating a module, now also a ``module.pyi`` file is created
  that contains all imported modules. This should be deployed alongside the
  extension module, so that standalone mode creation can benefit from knowing
  the dependencies of compiled code.

- Added option ``--plugin-list`` that was mentioned in the help output, but
  still missing so far.

- The import tracing of the ``hints`` module has achieved experimental status
  and can be used to test compatibility with regards to import behavior.

Cleanups
--------

- Rename tree and codegen ``Helper`` modules to unique names, making them
  easier to work with.

- Share the code that decides to not warn for standard library paths with more
  warnings.

- Use the ``bool`` enum definition of Python2 which is more elegant than ours.

- Move quality tools, autoformat, isort, etc. to the ``nuitka.tools.quality``
  namespace.

- Move output comparison tool to the ``nuitka.tools.testing`` namespace.

- Made frame code generation capable of using nested frames, allowing the real
  inline of classes and contraction bodies, instead of "direct" calls to pseudo
  functions being used.

- Proper base classes for functions that are entry points, and functions that
  are merely a local expression using return statements.

Tests
-----

- The search mode with pattern, was not working anymore.

- Resume hash values now consider the Python version too.

- Added test that covers using test runners like ``nose`` and ``py.test`` with
  Nuitka compiled extension modules.

Organizational
--------------

- Added support for Scons 3.0 and running Scons with Python3.5 or higher. The
  option to specifiy the Python to use for scons has been renamed to reflect
  that it may also be a Python3 now. Only for Python3.2 to Python3.4 we now
  need another Python installation.

- Made recursion the default for ``--recurse-directory`` with packages. Before
  you also had to tell it to recurse into that package or else it would only
  include the top level package, but nothing below.

- Updated the man pages, correct mentions of its C++ to C and don't use now
  deprecated options.

- Updated the help output which still said that standalone mode implies
  recursion into standard library, which is no longer true and even not
  recommended.

- Added option to disable the output of ``.pyi`` file when creating an extension
  module.

- Removed Ubuntu Wily package download, no longer supported by Ubuntu.

Summary
-------

This release was done to get the fixes and new features out for testing. There
is work started that should make generators use an explicit extra stack via
pointer, and restore instruction state via goto dispatchers at function entry,
but that is not complete.

This feature, dubbed "goto generators" will remove the need for fibers (which
is itself a lot of code), reduce the memory footprint at run time for anything
that uses a lot of generators, or coroutines.

Integrating with ``distutils`` is also a new thing, and once completed will
make use of Nuitka for existing projects automatic and trivial to do. There is
a lot missing for that goal, but we will get there.

Also, documenting how to run tests against compiled code, if that test code
lives inside of that package, will make a huge difference, as that will make
it easier for people to torture Nuitka with their own test cases.

And then of course, nested frames now mean that every function could be inlined,
which was previously not possible due to collisions of frames. This will pave
the route for better optimization in those cases in future releases.

The experimental features will require more work, but should make it easier to
use Nuitka for existing projects. Future releases will make integrating Nuitka
dead simple, or that is the hope.

And last but not least, now that Scons works with Python3, chances are that
Nuitka will more often work out the of the box. The older Python3 versions that
still retain the issue are not very widespread.


Nuitka Release 0.5.27
=====================

This release comes a lot of bug fixes and improvements.

Bug Fixes
---------

- Fix, need to add recursed modules immediately to the working set, or else
  they might first be processed in second pass, where global names that are
  locally assigned, are optimized to the built-in names although that should
  not happen. Fixed in 0.5.26.1 already.

- Fix, the accelerated call of methods could crash for some special types. This
  had been a regress of 0.5.25, but only happens with custom extension types.
  Fixed in 0.5.26.1 already.

- Python3.5: For ``async def`` functions parameter variables could fail to
  properly work with in-place assignments to them. Fixed in 0.5.26.4 already.

- Compatability: Decorators that overload type checks didn't pass the checks
  for compiled types. Now ``isinstance`` and as a result ``inspect`` module
  work fine for them.

- Compatiblity: Fix, imports from ``__init__`` were crashing the compiler. You
  are not supposed to do them, because they duplicate the package code, but
  they work.

- Compatiblity: Fix, the ``super`` built-in on module level was crashing the
  compiler.

- Standalone: For Linux, BSD and MacOS extension modules and shared libraries
  using their own ``$ORIGIN`` to find loaded DLLs resulted in those not being
  included in the distribution.

- Standalone: Added more missing implicit dependencies.

- Standalone: Fix, implicit imports now also can be optional, as e.g. ``_tkinter``
  if not installed. Only include those if available.

- The ``--recompile-c-only`` was only working with C compiler as a backend, but
  not in the C++ compatibility fallback, where files get renamed. This prevented
  that edit and test debug approach with at least MSVC.

- Plugins: The PyLint plug-in didn't consider the symbolic name ``import-error``
  but only the code ``F0401``.

- Implicit exception raises in conditional expressions would crash the compiler.

New Features
------------

- Added support for Visual Studio 2017. `Issue#368
  <http://bugs.nuitka.net/issue368>`__.

- Added option ``--python2-for-scons`` to specify the Python2 execute to
  use for calling Scons. This should allow using AnaConda Python for that
  task.

Optimization
------------

- References to known unassigned variables are now statically optimized to
  exception raises and warned about if the according option is enabled.

- Unhashable keys in dictionaries are now statically optimized to exception
  raises and warned about if the according option is enabled.

- Enable forward propagation for classes too, resulting in some classes
  to create only static dictionaries. Currently this never happens for
  Python3, but it will, once we can statically optimize ``__prepare__``
  too.

- Enable inlining of class dictionary creations if they are mere return
  statements of the created dictionary. Currently this never happens for
  Python3, see above for why.

- Python2: Selecting the metaclass is now visible in the tree and can be
  statically optimized.

- For executables, we now also use a freelist for traceback objects, which
  also makes exception cases slightly faster.

- Generator expressions no longer require the use of a function call with a
  ``.0`` argument value to carry the iterator value, instead their creation
  is directly inlined.

- Remove "pass through" frames for Python2 list contractions, they are no
  longer needed. Minimal gain for generated code, but more lightweight at
  compile time.

- When compiling Windows x64 with MinGW64 a link library needs to be created
  for linking against the Python DLL. This one is now cached and re-used if
  already done.

- Use common code for ``NameError`` and ``UnboundLocalError`` exception code
  raises. In some cases it was creating the full string at compile time, in
  others at run time. Since the later is more efficient in terms of code size,
  we now use that everywhere, saving a bit of binary size.

- Make sure to release unused functions from a module. This saves memory and
  can be decided after a full pass.

- Avoid using ``OrderedDict`` in a couple of places, where they are not needed,
  but can be replaced with a later sorting, e.g. temporary variables by name,
  to achieve deterministic output. This saves memory at compile time.

- Add specialized return nodes for the most frequent constant values, which
  are ``None``, ``True``, and ``False``. Also a general one, for constant value
  return, which avoids the constant references. This saves quite a bit of
  memory and makes traversal of the tree a lot faster, due to not having any
  child nodes for the new forms of return statements.

- Previously the empty dictionary constant reference was specialized to save
  memory. Now we also specialize empty set, list, and tuple constants to the
  same end. Also the hack to make ``is`` not say that ``{} is {}`` was made
  more general, mutable constant references and now known to never alias.

- The source references can be marked internal, which means that they should
  never be visible to the user, but that was tracked as a flag to each of the
  many source references attached to each node in the tree. Making a special
  class for internal references avoids storing this in the object, but instead
  it's now a class property.

- The nodes for named variable reference, assignment, and deletion got split
  into separate nodes, one to be used before the actual variable can be
  determined during tree building, and one for use later on. This makes their
  API clearer and saves a tiny bit of memory at compile time.

- Also eliminated target variable references, which were pseudo children of
  assignments and deletion nodes for variable names, that didn't really do
  much, but consume processing time and memory.

- Added optimization for calls to ``staticmethod`` and ``classmethod`` built-in
  methods along with type shapes.

- Added optimization for ``open`` built-in on Python3, also adding the type
  shape ``file`` for the result.

- Added optimization for ``bytearray`` built-in and constant values. These
  mutable constants can now be compile time computed as well.

- Added optimization for ``frozenset`` built-in and constant values. These
  mutable constants can now be compile time computed as well.

- Added optimization for ``divmod`` built-in.

- Treat all built-in constant types, e.g. ``type`` itself as a constant. So
  far we did this only for constant values types, but of course this applies
  to all types, giving slightly more compact code for their uses.

- Detect static raises if iterating over non-iterables and warn about them if
  the option is enabled.

- Split of ``locals`` node into different types, one which needs the updated
  value, and one which just makes a copy. Properly track if a functions needs
  an updated locals dict, and if it doesn't, don't use that. This gives more
  efficient code for Python2 classes, and ``exec`` using functions in Python2.

- Build all constant values without use of the ``pickle`` module which has a
  lot more overhead than ``marshal``, instead use that for too large ``long``
  values, non-UTF8 ``unicode`` values, ``nan`` float, etc.

- Detect the linker arch for all Linux platforms using ``objdump`` instead
  of only a hand few hard coded ones.

Cleanups
--------

- The use of ``INCREASE_REFCOUNT`` got fully eliminated.

- Use functions not vulenerable for buffer overflow. This is generally good
  and avoids warnings given on OpenBSD during linking.

- Variable closure for classes is different from all functions, don't handle
  the difference in the base class, but for class nodes only.

- Make sure ``mayBeNone`` doesn't return ``None`` which means normally "unclear",
  but ``False`` instead, since it's always clear for those cases.

- Comparison nodes were using the general comparison node as a base class,
  but now a proper base class was added instead, allowing for cleaner code.

- Valgrind test runners got changed to using proper tool namespace for their
  code and share it.

- Made construct case generation code common testing code for re-use in the
  speedcenter web site. The code also has minor beauty bugs which will then
  become fixable.

- Use ``appdirs`` package to determine place to store the downloaded copy of
  ``depends.exe``.

- The code still mentioned C++ in a lot of places, in comments or identifiers,
  which might be confusing readers of the code.

- Code objects now carry all information necessary for their creation, and
  no longer need to access their parent to determine flag values. That parent
  is subject to change in the future.

- Our import sorting wrapper automatically detects imports that could be local
  and makes them so, removing a few existing ones and preventing further ones
  on the future.

- Cleanups and annotations to become Python3 PyLint clean as well. This found
  e.g. that source code references only had ``__cmp__`` and need rich comparison
  to be fully portable.

Tests
-----

- The test runner for construct tests got cleaned up and the constructs now
  avoid using ``xrange`` so as to not need conversion for Python3 execution as
  much.

- The main test runner got cleaned up and uses common code making it more
  versatile and robust.

- Do not run test in debugger if CPython also segfaulted executing the test,
  then it's not a Nuitka issue, so we can ignore that.

- Improve the way the Python to test with is found in the main test runner,
  prefer the running interpreter, then ``PATH`` and registry on Windows,
  this will find the interesting version more often.

- Added support for "Landscape.io" to ignore the inline copies of code, they
  are not under our control.

- The test runner for Valgrind got merged with the usage for constructs and
  uses common code now.

- Construct generation is now common code, intended for sharing it with the
  Speedcenter web site generation.

- Rebased Python 3.6 test suite to 3.6.1 as that is the Python generally used
  now.

Organizational
--------------

- Added inline copy of ``appdirs`` package from PyPI.

- Added credits for RedBaron and isort.

- The ``--experimental`` flag is now creating a list of indications and more
  than one can be used that way.

- The PyLint runner can also work with Python3 pylint.

- The Nuitka Speedcenter got more fine tuning and produces more tags to
  more easily identify trends in results. This needs to become more visible
  though.

- The MSI files are also built on AppVeyor, where their building will not
  depend on me booting Windows. Getting these artifacts as downloads will
  be the next step.

Summary
-------

This release improves many areas. The variable closure taking is now fully
transparent due to different node types, the memory usage dropped again,
a few obvious missing static optimizations were added, and many built-ins
were completed.

This release again improves the scalability of Nuitka, which again uses
less memory than before, although not an as big jump as before.

This does not extend or use special C code generation for ``bool`` or any
type yet, which still needs design decisions to proceed and will come
in a later release.


Nuitka Release 0.5.26
=====================

This release comes after a long time and contains large amounts of changes in
all areas. The driving goal was to prepare generating C specific code, which is
still not the case, but this is very likely going to change soon. However this
release improves all aspects.

Bug Fixes
---------

- Compatibility: Fix, for star imports didn't check the values from the
  ``__all__`` iterable, if they were string values which could cause
  problems at run time.

  .. code-block:: python

    # Module level
    __all__ = (1,)

    # ...
    # other module:
    from module import *

- Fix, for star imports, also didn't check for values from ``__all__``
  if they actually exist in the original values.

- Corner cases of imports should work a lot more precise, as the level of
  compatibility for calls to ``__import__`` went from absurd to insane.

- Windows: Fixed detection of uninstalled Python versions (not for all users
  and DLL is not in system directory). This of course only affected the
  accelerated mode, not standalone mode.

- Windows: Scan directories for ``.pyd`` files for used DLLs as well. This
  should make the PyQt5 wheel work.

- Python3.5: Fix, coroutines could have different code objects for the object
  and the frame using by it.

- Fix, slices with built-in names crashed the compiler.

  .. code-block:: python

     something[id:len:range]

- Fix, the C11 via C++ compatibility uses symlinks tp C++ filenames where
  possible instead of making a copy from the C source. However, even on Linux
  that may not be allowed, e.g. on a DOS file system. Added fallback to using
  full copy in that case. `Issue#353 <http://bugs.nuitka.net/issue353>`__.

- Python3.5: Fix coroutines to close the "yield from" where an exception is
  thrown into them.

- Python3: Fix, list contractions should have their own frame too.

- Linux: Copy the "rpath" of compiling Python binary to the created
  binary. This will make compiled binaries using uninstalled Python
  versions transparently find the Python shared library.

- Standalone: Add the "rpath" of the compiling Python binary to the
  search path when checking for DLL dependencies on Linux. This fixes
  standalone support for Travis and Anaconda on Linux.

- Scons: When calling scons, also try to locate a Python2 binary to
  overcome a potential Python3 virtualenv in which Nuitka is running.

- Standalone: Ignore more Windows only encodings on non-Windows.

New Features
------------

- Support for Python 3.6 with only few corner cases not supported yet.

- Added options ``--python-arch`` to pick 32 or 64 bits Python target of
  the ``--python-version`` argument.

- Added support for more kinds of virtualenv configurations.

- Uninstalled Python versions such as Anaconda will work fine in accelerated
  mode, except on Windows.

Optimization
------------

- The node tree children are no longer stored in a separate dictionary, but
  in the instance dictionary as attributes, making the tree more lightweight
  and in principle faster to access. This also saved about 6% of the memory
  usage.

- The memory usage of Nuitka for the Python part has fallen by roughly 40%
  due to the use of new style classes, and slots where that is possible (some
  classes use multiple inheritance, where they don't work), and generally by
  reducing useless members e.g. in source code references. This of course also
  will make things compiled faster (the C compilation of course is not affected
  by this.)

- The code generation for frames was creating the dictionary for the raised
  exception by making a dictionary and then adding all variables, each tested
  to be set. This was a lot of code for each frame specific, and has been
  replaced by a generic "attach" mechanism which merely stores the values,
  and only takes a reference. When asked for frame locals, it only then builds
  the dictionary. So this is now only done, when that is absolutely necessary,
  which it normally never is. This of course makes the C code much less verbose,
  and actual handling of exceptions much more efficient.

- For imports, we now detect for built-in modules, that their import cannot
  fail, and if name lookups can fail. This leads to less code generated for
  error handling of these. The following code now e.g. fully detects that
  no ``ImportError`` or ``AttributeError`` will occur.

  .. code-block:: python

    try:
        from __builtin__ import len
    except ImportError:
        from builtins import len

- Added more type shapes for built-in type calls. These will improve
  type tracing.

- Compiled frames now have a free list mechanism that should speed up
  frames that recurse and frames that exit with exceptions. In case of
  an exception, the frame ownership is immediately transferred to the
  exception making it easier to deal with.

- The free list implementations have been merged into a new common one
  that can be used via macro expansion. It is now type agnostic and be
  slightly more efficient too.

- Also optimize "true" division and "floor division", not only the
  default division of Python2.

- Removed the need for statement context during code generation making it
  less memory intensive and faster.

Cleanups
--------

- Now always uses the ``__import__`` built-in node for all kinds of imports
  and directly optimizes and recursion into other modules based on that kind
  of node, instead of a static variant. This removes duplication and some
  incompatability regarding defaults usage when doing the actual imports at
  run time.

- Split the expression node bases and mixin classes to a dedicated module,
  moving methods that only belong to expressions outside of the node base,
  making for a cleaner class hierachy.

- Cleaned up the class structure of nodes, added base classes for typical
  compositions, e.g. expression with and without children, computation based
  on built-in, etc. while also checking proper ordering of base classes in
  the metaclass.

- Moved directory and file operations to dedicated module, making also sure
  it is more generally used. This makes it easier to make more error resilient
  deletions of directories on e.g. Windows, where locks tend to live for short
  times beyond program ends, requiring second attempts.

- Code generation for existing supported types, ``PyObject *``, ``PyObject **``,
  and ``struct Nuitka_CellObject *`` is now done via a C type class hierachy
  instead of ``elif`` sequences.

- Closure taking is now always done immediately correctly and references are
  take for closure variables still needed, making sure the tree is correct and
  needs no finalization.

- When doing variable traces, initialize more traces immediately so it can be
  more reliable.

- Code to setup a function for local variables and clean it up has been made
  common code instead of many similar copies.

- The code was treating the ``f_executing`` frame member as if it were a
  counter with increases and decreases. Turn it into a mere boolean value
  and hide its usage behind helper functions.

- The "maybe local variables" are no more. They were replaced by a new
  locals dict access node with a fallback to a module or closure variable
  should the dictionary not contain the name. This avoids many ugly checks
  to not do certain things for that kind of variable.

- We now detect "exec" and "unqualified exec" as well as "star import"
  ahead of time as flags of the function to be created. We no longer need
  to mark functions as we go.

- Handle "true", "floor" and normal division properly by applying future
  flags to decide which one to use.

- We now use symbolic identifiers in all PyLint annotations.

- The release scripts started to move into ``nuitka.tools.release`` so they
  get PyLint checks, autoformat and proper code re-use.

- The use of ``INCREASE_REFCOUNT_X`` was removed, it got replaced with proper
  ``Py_XINCREF`` usages.

- The use of ``INCREASE_REFCOUNT`` got reduced further, e.g. no generated code
  uses it anymore, and only a few compiled types do. The function was once
  required before "C-ish" lifted the need to do everything in one single
  function call.

Tests
-----

- More robust deletion of directories, temporary stages used by CPython test
  suites, and standalone directories during test execution.

- Moved tests common code into ``nuitka.tools.testing`` namespace and use it
  from there. The code now is allowed to use ``nuitka.utils`` and therefore
  often better implementations.

- Made standalone binaries robust against GTK theme access, checking the
  Python binary (some site.py files do that),

Organizational
--------------

- Added repository for Ubuntu Zesty (17.04) for download.

- Added support for testing with Travis to complement the internal Buildbot
  based infrastructure and have pull requests on Github automatically tested
  before merge.

- The ``factory`` branch is now also on Github.

- Removed MSI for Python3.4 32 bits. It seems impossible to co-install this
  one with the 64 bits variant. All other versions are provided for both
  bit sizes still.

Summary
-------

This release marks huge progress. The node tree is now absolutely clean, the
variable closure taking is fully represented, and code generation is prepared
to add another type, e.g. for ``bool`` for which work has already started.

On a practical level, the scalability of the release will have increased very
much, as this uses so much less memory, generates simpler C code, while at the
same time getting faster for the exception cases.

Coming releases will expand on the work of this release.

Frame objects should be allowed to be nested inside a function for better
re-formulations of classes and contractions of all kinds, as well as real
inline of functions, even if they could raise.

The memory savings could be even larger, if we stopped doing multiple
inheritance for more node types. The ``__slots__`` were and the child API
change could potentially make things not only more compact, but faster to
use too.

And also once special C code generation for ``bool`` is done, it will set the
stage for more types to follow (``int``, ``float``, etc). Only this will
finally start to give the C type speed we are looking for.

Until then, this release marks a huge cleanup and progress to what we already
had, as well as preparing the big jump in speed.


Nuitka Release 0.5.25
=====================

This release contains a huge amount of bug fixes, lots of optimization gains,
and many new features. It also presents many organizational improvements,
and many cleanups.

Bug Fixes
---------

- Python3.5: Coroutine methods using ``super`` were crashing the compiler.
  `Issue#340 <http://bugs.nuitka.net/issue340>`__. Fixed in 0.5.24.2 already.

- Python3.3: Generator return values were not properly transmitted in case of
  ``tuple`` or ``StopIteration`` values.

- Python3.5: Better interoperability between compiled coroutines and uncompiled
  generator coroutines.

- Python3.5: Added support to compile in Python debug mode under Windows too.

- Generators with arguments were using two code objects, one with, and one
  without the ``CO_NOFREE`` flag, one for the generator object creating
  function, and one for the generator object.

- Python3.5: The duplicate code objects for generators with arguments lead
  to interoperability issues with between such compiled generator coroutines
  and compiled coroutines. `Issue#341 <http://bugs.nuitka.net/issue341>`__.
  Fixed in 0.5.24.2 already.

- Standalone: On some Linux variants, e.g. Debian Stretch and Gentoo, the linker
  needs more flags to really compile to a binary with ``RPATH``.

- Compatibility: For set literal values, insertion order is wrong on some
  versions of Python, we now detect the bug and emulate it if necessary,
  previous Nuitka was always correct, but incompatible.

  .. code-block:: python

    {1, 1.0}.pop() # the only element of the set should be 1

- Windows: Make the batch files detect where they live at run time, instead of
  during ``setup.py``, making it possible to use them for all cases.

- Standalone: Added package paths to DLL scan for ``depends.exe``, as with
  wheels there now sometimes live important DLLs too.

- Fix, the clang mode was regressed and didn't work anymore, breaking the
  MacOS support entirely.

- Compatibility: For imports, we were passing for ``locals`` argument a real
  dictionary with actual values. That is not what CPython does, so stopped
  doing it.

- Fix, for raised exceptions not passing the validity tests, they could be
  used after free, causing crashes.

- Fix, the environment ``CC`` wasn't working unless also specifying ``CXX``.

- Windows: The value of ``__file__`` in module mode was wrong, and didn't point
  to the compiled module.

- Windows: Better support for ``--python-debug`` for installations that have
  both variants, it is now possible to switch to the right variant.

New Features
------------

- Added parsing for shebang to Nuitka. When compiling an executable, now Nuitka
  will check of the ``#!`` portion indicates a different Python version and ask
  the user to clarify with ``--python-version`` in case of a mismatch.

- Added support for Python flag ``-O``, which allows to disable assertions and
  remove doc strings.

Optimization
------------

- Faster method calls, combining attribute lookup and method call into one,
  where order of evaluation with arguments doesn't matter. This gives really
  huge relative speedups for method calls with no arguments.

- Faster attribute lookup in general for ``object`` descendants, which is all
  new style classes, and all built-in types.

- Added dedicated ``xrange`` built-in implementation for Python2 and ``range``
  for Python3. This makes those faster while also solving ordering problems
  when creating constants of these types.

- Faster ``sum`` again, using quick iteration interface and specialized quick
  iteration code for typical standard type containers, ``tuple`` and ``list``.

- Compiled generators were making sure ``StopIteration`` was set after their
  iteration, although most users were only going to clear it. Now only the
  ``send`` method, which really needs that does it. This speed up the closing
  of generators quite a bit.

- Compiled generators were preparing a ``throw`` into non-started compilers,
  to be checked for immediately after their start. This is now handled in a
  generic way for all generators, saving code and execution time in the normal
  case.

- Compiled generators were applying checks only useful for manual ``send`` calls
  even during iteration, slowing them down.

- Compiled generators could duplicate code objects due to handling a flag for
  closure variables differently.

- For compiled frames, the ``f_trace`` is not writable, but was taking and
  releasing references to what must be ``None``, which is not useful.

- Not passing ``locals`` to import calls make it less code and faster too.

Organizational
--------------

- This release also prepares Python 3.6 support, it includes full language
  support on the level of CPython 3.6.0 with the sole exception of the new
  generator coroutines.

- The improved mode is now the default, and full compatibility is now the
  option, used by test suites. For syntax errors, improved mode is always
  used, and for test suites, now only the error message is compared, but
  not call stack or caret positioning anymore.

- Removed long deprecated option "--no-optimization". Code generation too
  frequently depends on not seeing unoptimized code. This has been hidden
  and broken long enough to finally remove it.

- Added support for Python3.5 numbers to Speedcenter. There are now also tags
  for speedcenter, indicating how well "develop" branch fares in comparison
  to master.

- With a new tool, source code and developer manual contents can be kept in
  sync, so that descriptions can be quoted there. Eventually a full Sphinx
  documentation might become available, but for now this makes it workable.

- Added repository for Ubuntu Yakkety (16.10) for download.

- Added repository for Fedora 25 for download.

Cleanups
--------

- Moved the tools to compare CPython output, to sort import statements (isort)
  to autoformat the source code (Redbaron usage), and to check with PyLint to
  a common new ``nuitka.tools`` package, runnable with ``__main__`` modules
  and dedicated runners in ``bin`` directory.

- The tools now share code to find source files, or have it for the first time,
  and other things, e.g. finding needed binaries on Windows installations.

- No longer patch traceback objects dealloc function. Should not be needed
  anymore, and most probably was only bug hiding.

- Moved handling of ast nodes related to import handling to the proper
  reformulation module.

- Moved statement generation code to helpers module, making it accessible
  without cyclic dependencies that require local imports.

- Removed deprecated method for getting constant code objects in favor of
  the new way of doing it. Both methods were still used, making it harder
  to analyse.

- Removed useless temporary variable initializations from complex call helper
  internal functions. They worked around code generation issues that have long
  been solved.

- The ABI flags are no longer passed to Scons together with the version.

Tests
-----

- Windows: Added support to detect and to switch debug Python where available
  to also be able to execute reference counting tests.

- Added the CPython 3.3 test suite, after cleaning up the worst bits of it,
  and added the brandnew 3.6 test suite with a minimal set of changes.

- Use the original 3.4 test suite instead of the one that comes from Debian
  as it has patched quite a few issues that never made it upstream, and might
  cause crashes.

- More construct tests, making a difference between old style classes, which
  have instances and new style classes, with their objects.

- It is now possible to run a test program with Python3 and Valgrind.

Summary
-------

The quick iteration is a precursor to generally faster iteration over unknown
object iterables. Expanding this to general code generation, and not just the
``sum`` built-in, might yield significant gains for normal code in the future,
once we do code generation based on type inference.

The faster method calls complete work that was already prepared in this domain
and also will be expanded to more types than compiled functions. More work will
be needed to round this up.

Adding support for 3.6.0 in the early stages of its release, made sure we
pretty much have support for it ready right after release. This is always a
huge amount of work, and it's good to catch up.

This release is again a significant improvement in performance, and is
very important to clean up open ends. Now the focus of coming releases
will now be on both structural optimization, e.g. taking advantage of
the iterator tracing, and specialized code generation, e.g. for those
iterations really necessary to use quick iteration code.


Nuitka Release 0.5.24
=====================

This release is again focusing on optimization, this time very heavily on
the generator performance, which was found to be much slower than CPython
for some cases. Also there is the usual compatibility work and improvements
for Pure C support.

Bug Fixes
---------

- Windows: The 3.5.2 coroutine new protocol implementation was using the wrapper
  from CPython, but it's not part of the ABI on Windows. Have our own instead.
  Fixed in 0.5.23.1 already.

- Windows: Fixed second compilation with MSVC failing. The files renamed to be
  C++ files already existed, crashing the compilation. Fixed in 0.5.23.1
  already.

- Mac OS: Fixed creating extension modules with ``.so`` suffix. This is now
  properly determined by looking at the importer details, leading to correct
  suffix on all platforms. Fixed in 0.5.23.1 already.

- Debian: Don't depend on a C++ compiler primarily anymore, the C compiler from
  GNU or clang will do too. Fixed in 0.5.23.1 already.

- Pure C: Adapted scons compiler detecting to properly consider C11 compilers
  from the environment, and more gracefully report things.

Optimization
------------

- Python2: Generators were saving and restoring exceptions, updating the
  variables ``sys.exc_type`` for every context switch, making it really slow,
  as these are 3 dictionary updates, normally not needed. Now it's only doing
  it if it means a change.

- Sped up creating generators, coroutines and coroutines by attaching the
  closure variable storage directly to the object, using one variable size
  allocation, instead of two, once of which was a standard ``malloc``. This
  makes creating them easier and avoids maintaining the closure pointer
  entirely.

- Using dedicated compiled cell implementation similar to ``PyCellObject`` but
  fully under our control. This allowed for smaller code generated, while still
  giving a slight performance improvement.

- Added free list implementation to cache generator, coroutines, and function
  objects, avoiding the need to create and delete this kind of objects in a
  loop.

- Added support for the built-in ``sum``, making slight optimizations to be much
  faster when iterating over lists and tuples, as well as fast ``long`` sum for
  Python2, and much faster ``bool`` sums too. This is using a prototype version
  of a "qiter" concept.

- Provide type shape for ``xrange`` calls that are not constant too, allowing
  for better optimization related to those.

Tests
-----

- Added workarounds for locks being held by Virus Scanners on Windows to our
  test runner.

- Enhanced constructs that test generator expressions to more clearly show the
  actual construct cost.

- Added construct tests for the ``sum`` built-in on verious types of ``int``
  containers, making sure we can do all of those really fast.

Summary
-------

This release improves very heavily on generators in Nuitka. The memory allocator
is used more cleverly, and free lists all around save a lot of interactions with
it. More work lies ahead in this field, as these are not yet as fast as they
should be. However, at least Nuitka should be faster than CPython for these kind
of usages now.

Also, proper pure C in the Scons is relatively important to cover more of the
rarer use cases, where the C compiler is too old.

The most important part is actually how ``sum`` optimization is staging a new
kind of approach for code generation. This could become the standard code for
iterators in loops eventually, making ``for`` loops even faster. This will be
for future releases to expand.


Nuitka Release 0.5.23
=====================

This release is focusing on optimization, the most significant part for the
users being enhanced scalability due to memory usage, but also break through
structural improvements for static analysis of iterators and the debut of
type shapes and value shapes, giving way to "shape tracing".

Bug Fixes
---------

- Fix support Python 3.5.2 coroutine changes. The checks got added for
  improved mode for older 3.5.x, the new protocol is only supported when
  run with that version or higher.

- Fix, was falsely optimizing away unused iterations for non-iterable compile
  time constants.

  .. code-block:: python

    iter(1) # needs to raise.

- Python3: Fix, ``eval`` must not attempt to ``strip`` memoryviews. The was
  preventing it from working with that type.

- Fix, calling ``type`` without any arguments was crashing the compiler. Also
  the exception raised for anything but 1 or 3 arguments was claiming that only
  3 arguments were allowed, which is not the compatible thing.

- Python3.5: Fix, follow enhanced error checking for complex call handling of
  star arguments.

- Compatibility: The ``from x import x, y`` re-formulation was doing two
  ``__import__`` calls instead of re-using the module value.

Optimization
------------

- Uses only about 66% of the memory compared to last release, which is
  very important step for scalability independent of re-loading. This
  was achieved by making sure to break loop traces and their reference
  cycle when they become unused.

- Properly detect the ``len`` of multiplications at compile time from
  newly introduces value shapes, so that this is e.g. statically optimized.

  .. code-block:: python

    print(len("*" * 10000000000))

- Due to newly introduced type shapes, ``len`` and ``iter`` now properly
  detect more often if values will raise or not, and warn about detected
  raises.

  .. code-block:: python

     iter(len((something)) # Will always raise

- Due to newly introduced "iterator tracing", we can now properly detect if
  the length of an unpacking matches its source or not. This allows to remove
  the check of the generic re-formulations of unpackings at compile time.

  .. code-block:: python

     a, b = b, a    # Will never raise due to unpacking
     a, b = b, a, c # Will always raise, 3 items cannot unpack to 2

- Added support for optimization of the ``xrange`` built-in for Python2.

- Python2: Added support for ``xrange`` iterable constant values, pre-building
  those constants ahead of time.

- Python3: Added support and ``range`` iterable constant values, pre-building
  those constants ahead of time. This brings optimization support for Python3
  ranges to what was available for Python2 already.

- Avoid having a special node variange for ``range`` with no arguments, but
  create the exception raising node directly.

- Specialized constant value nodes are using less generic implementations to
  query e.g. their length or iteration capabilities, which should speed up
  many checks on them.

- Added support for the ``format`` built-in.

- Python3: Added support for the ``ascii`` built-in.

Organizational
--------------

- The movement to pure C got the final big push. All C++ only idoms of C++ were
  removed, and everything works with C11 compilers. A C++03 compiler can be used
  as a fallback, in case of MSVC or too old gcc for instance.

- Using pure C, MinGW64 6x is now working properly. The latest version had
  problems with ``hypot`` related changes in the C++ standard library. Using
  C11 solves that.

- This release also prepares Python 3.6 support, it includes full language
  support on the level of CPython 3.6.0b1.

- The CPython 3.6 test suite was run with Python 3.5 to ensure bug level
  compatibility, and had a few findings of incompatibilities.

Cleanups
--------

- The last holdouts of classes in Nuitka were removed, and many idioms of C++
  were stopped using.

- Moved range related helper functions to a dedicated include file.

- Using ``str is not bytes`` to detect Python3 ``str`` handling or
  actual ``bytes`` type existence.

- Trace collections were using a mix-in that was merged with the base
  class that every user of it was having.

Tests
-----

- Added more static optimization tests, a lot more has become feasible to
  decide at run time, and is now done. These are to detect regressions in
  that domain.

- The CPython 3.6 test suite is now also run with CPython 3.5 which found
  some incompatibilities.

Summary
-------

This release marks a huge step forward. We are having the structure for type
inference now. This will expand in coming releases to cover more cases, and
there are many low hanging fruits for optimization. Specialized codes for
variable versions of certain known shapes seems feasible now.

Then there is also the move towards pure C. This will make the backend
compilation lighter, but due to using C11, we will not suffer any loss of
convinience compared to "C-ish". The plan is to use continue to use C++ for
compilation for compilers not capable of supporting C11.

The amount of static analysis done in Nuitka is now going to quickly expand,
with more and more constructs predicted to raise errors or simplified. This
will be an ongoing activity, as many types of expressions need to be enhanced,
and only one missing will not let it optimize as well.

Also, it seems about time to add dedicated code for specific types to be as
fast as C code. This opens up vast possibilities for acceleration and will
lead us to zero overhead C bindings eventually. But initially the drive is
towards enhanced ``import`` analysis, to become able to know the precide module
expected to be imported, and derive type information from this.

The coming work will attack to start whole program optimization, as well as
enhanced local value shape analysis, as well specialized type code generation,
which will make Nuitka improve speed.


Nuitka Release 0.5.22
=====================

This release is mostly an intermediate release on the way to the large goal
of having per module compilation that is cachable and requires far less memory
for large programs. This is currently in progress, but required many changes
that are in this release, more will be needed.

It also contains a bunch of bug fixes and enhancements that are worth to
be released, and the next changes are going to be more invasive.

Bug Fixes
---------

- Compatibility: Classes with decorated ``__new__`` functions could miss
  out on the ``staticmethod`` decorator that is implicit. It's now applied
  always, unless of course it's already done manually. This corrects an
  issue found with Pandas. Fixed in 0.5.22.1 already.

- Standalone: For at least Python 3.4 or higher, it could happen that the
  locale needed was not importable. Fixed in 0.5.22.1 already.

- Compatibility: Do not falsely assume that ``not`` expressions cannot raise
  on boolean expressions, since those arguments might raise during creation.
  This could lead to wrong optimization. Fixed in 0.5.22.2 already.

- Standalone: Do not include system specific C libraries in the distribution
  created. This would lead to problems for some configurations on Linux in
  cases the glibc is no longer compatible with newer oder older kernels.
  Fixed in 0.5.22.2 already.

- The ``--recurse-directory`` option didn't check with decision mechanisms
  for module inclusion, making it impossible to avoid some things.

Optimization
------------

- Introduced specialized constant classes for empty dictionaries and other
  special constants, e.g. "True" and "False", so that they can have more
  hard coded properties and save memory by sharing constant values.

- The "technical" sharing of a variable is only consider for variables that
  had some sharing going in the first place, speeing things up quite a bit
  for that still critical check.

- Memory savings coming from enhanced trace storage are already visible at
  about 1%. That is not as much as the reloading will mean, but still helpful
  to use less overall.


Cleanups
--------

- The global variable registry was removed. It was in the way of unloading
  and reloading modules easily. Instead variables are now attached to their
  owner and referenced by other users. When they are released, these variables
  are released.

- Global variable traces were removed. Instead each variable has a list of the
  traces attached to it. For non-shared variables, this allows to sooner tell
  attributes of those variables, allowing for sooner optimization of them.

- No longer trace all initial users of a variable, just merely if there were
  such and if it constitutes sharing syntactically too. Not only does this
  save memory, it avoids useless references of the variable to functions that
  stop using it due to optimization.

- Create constant nodes via a factory function to avoid non-special instances
  where variants exist that would be faster to use.

- Moved the C string functions to a proper ``nuitka.utils.CStrings`` package
  as we use it for better code names of functions and modules.

- Made ``functions`` and explicit child node of modules, which makes their
  use more generic, esp. for re-loading modules.

- Have a dedicated function for building frame nodes, making it easier to see
  where they are created.

Summary
-------

This release is the result of a couple of months work, and somwhat means that
proper re-loading of cached results is becoming in sight. The reloading of
modules still fails for some things, and more changes will be needed, but with
that out of the way, Nuitka's footprint is about to drop and making it then
absolutely scalable. Something considered very important before starting to
trace more information about values.

This next thing big ought to be one thing that structurally holds Nuitka back
from generating C level performance code with say integer operations.


Nuitka Release 0.5.21
=====================

This release focused on scalability work. Making Nuitka more usable in the
common case, and covering more standalone use cases.

Bug Fixes
---------

- Windows: Support for newer MinGW64 was broken by a workaround for older
  MinGW64 versions.

- Compatibility: Added support for the (inofficial) C-Python API
  ``Py_GetArgcArgv`` that was causing ``prctl`` module to fail loading on ARM
  platforms.

- Compatibility: The proper error message template for complex call arguments
  is now detected as compile time. There are changes comming, that are already
  in some pre-releases of CPython.

- Standalone: Wasn't properly ignoring ``Tools`` and other directories in the
  standard library.

New Features
------------

- Windows: Detect the MinGW compiler arch and compare it to the Python arch. In
  case of a mismatch, the compiler is not used. Otherwise compilation or
  linking gives hard to understand errors. This also rules out MinGW32 as
  a compiler that can be used, as its arch doesn't match MinGW64 32 bits
  variant.

- Compile modules in two passes with the option to specify which modules will
  be considered for a second pass at all (compiled without program optimization)
  or even become bytecode.

- The developer mode installation of Nuitka in ``develop`` mode with the
  command ``pip install -e nuitka_git_checkout_dir`` is now supported too.

Optimization
------------

- Popular modules known to not be performance relevant are no longer C compiled,
  e.g. ``numpy.distutils`` and many others frequently imported (from some other
  module), but mostly not used and definitely not performance relevant.

Cleanups
--------

- The progress tracing and the memory tracing and now more clearly separate
  and therefore more readable.

- Moved RPM related files to new ``rpm`` directory.

- Moved documentation related files to ``doc`` directory.

- Converted import sorting helper script to Python and made it run fast.

Organizational
--------------

- The Buildbot infrastructure for Nuitka was updated to Buildbot 0.8.12 and is
  now maintained up to date with Ansible.

- Upgraded the Nuitka bug tracker to Roundup 1.5.1 to which I had previously
  contributed security fixes already active.

- Added SSL certificates from Let's Encrypt for the web server.

Summary
-------

This release advances the scalability of Nuitka somewhat. The two pass approach
does not yet carry all possible fruits. Caching of single pass compiled modules
should follow for it to become consistently fast.

More work will be needed to achieve fast and scalable compilation, and that is
going to remain the focus for some time.


Nuitka Release 0.5.20
=====================

This release is mostly about catching up with issues. Most address standalone
problems with special modules, but there are also some general compatibility
corrections, as well as important fixes for Python3.5 and coroutines and to
improve compatibility with special Python variants like AnaConda under the
Windows system.

Bug Fixes
---------

- Standalone Python3.5: The ``_decimal`` module at least is using a ``__name__``
  that doesn't match the name at load time, causing programs that use it to
  crash.

- Compatibility: For Python3.3 the ``__loader__`` attribute is now set in all
  cases, and it needs to have a ``__module__`` attribute. This makes inspection
  as done by e.g. ``flask`` working.

- Standalone: Added missing hidden dependencies for ``Tkinter`` module, adding
  support for this to work properly.

- Windows: Detecting the Python DLL and EXE used at compile time and preserving
  this information use during backend compilation. This should make sure we use
  the proper ones, and avoids hacks for specific Python variants, enhancing the
  support for AnaConda, WinPython, and CPython installations.

- Windows: The ``--python-debug`` flag now properly detects if the run time
  is supporting things and error exits if it's not available. For a CPython3.5
  installation, it will switch between debug and non-debug Python binaries and
  DLLs.

- Standalone: Added plug-in for the ``Pwm`` package to properly combine it into
  a single file, suitable for distribution.

- Standalone: Packages from standard library, e.g. ``xml`` now have proper
  ``__path__`` as a list and not as a string value, which breaks code of e.g.
  PyXML. `Issue#183 <http://bugs.nuitka.net/issue183>`__.

- Standalone: Added missing dependency of ``twisted.protocols.tls``. `Issue#288
  <http://bugs.nuitka.net/issue288>`__.

- Python3.5: When finalizing coroutines that were not finished, a corruption of
  its reference count could happen under some circumstances.

- Standalone: Added missing DLL dependency of the ``uuid`` module at run time,
  which uses ctypes to load it.

New Features
------------

- Added support for AnaConda Python on this Linux. Both accelerated and
  standalone mode work now. `Issue#295 <http://bugs.nuitka.net/issue295>`__.

- Added support for standalone mode on FreeBSD. `Issue#294
  <http://bugs.nuitka.net/issue294>`__.

- The plug-in framework was expanded with new features to allow addressing some
  specific issues.

Cleanups
--------

- Moved memory related stuff to dedicated utils package
  ``nuitka.utils.MemoryUsage`` as part of an effort to have more topical
  modules.

- Plug-ins how have a dedicated module through which the core accesses the API,
  which was partially cleaned up.

- No more "early" and "late" import detections for standalone mode. We now scan
  everything at the start.

Summary
-------

This release focused on expanding plugins. These were then used to enhance the
success of standalone compatibility. Eventually this should lead to a finished
and documented plug-in API, which will open up the Nuitka core to easier hacks
and more user contribution for these topics.


Nuitka Release 0.5.19
=====================

This release brings optimization improvements for dictionary using code. This
is now lowering subscripts to dictionary accesses where possible and adds new
code generation for known dictionary values. Besides this there is the usual
range of bug fixes.

Bug Fixes
---------

- Fix, attribute assignments or deletions where the assigned value or the
  attribute source was statically raising crashed the compiler.

- Fix, the order of evaluation during optimization was considered in the wrong
  order for attribute assignments source and value.

- Windows: Fix, when ``g++`` is the path, it was not used automatically, but
  now it is.

- Windows: Detect the 32 bits variant of MinGW64 too.

- Python3.4: The finalize of compiled generators could corrupt reference counts
  for shared generator objects. Fixed in 0.5.18.1 already.

- Python3.5: The finalize of compiled coroutines could corrupt reference counts
  for shared generator objects.

Optimization
------------

- When a variable is known to have dictionary shape (assigned from a constant
  value, result of ``dict`` built-in, or a general dictionary creation), or
  the branch merge thereof, we lower subscripts from expecting mapping nodes
  to dictionary specific nodes. These generate more efficient code, and some
  are then known to not raise an exception.

  .. code-block:: python

    def someFunction(a,b):
        value = {a : b}
        value["c"] = 1
        return value

  The above function is not yet fully optimized (dictionary key/value tracing
  is not yet finished), however it at least knows that no exception can raise
  from assigning ``value["c"]`` anymore and creates more efficient code for the
  typical ``result = {}`` functions.

- The use of "logical" sharing during optimization has been replaced with checks
  for actual sharing. So closure variables that were written to in dead code no
  longer inhibit optimization of the then no more shared local variable.

- Global variable traces are now faster to decide definite writes without need
  to check traces for this each time.

Cleanups
--------

- No more using "logical sharing" allowed to remove that function entirely.

- Using "technical sharing" less often for decisions during optimization and
  instead rely more often on proper variable registry.

- Connected variables with their global variable trace statically avoid the
  need to check in variable registry for it.

- Removed old and mostly unused  "assume unclear locals" indications, we use
  global variable traces for this now.

Summary
-------

This release aimed at dictionary tracing. As a first step, the value assign is
now traced to have a dictionary shape, and this this then used to lower the
operations which used to be normal subscript operations to mapping, but now
can be more specific.

Making use of the dictionary values knowledge, tracing keys and values is not
yet inside the scope, but expected to follow. We got the first signs of type
inference here, but to really take advantage, more specific shape tracing will
be needed.


Nuitka Release 0.5.18
=====================

This release mainly has a scalability focus. While there are few compatibility
improvements, the larger goal has been to make Nuitka compilation and the final
C compilation faster.

Bug Fixes
---------

- Compatibility: The nested arguments functions can now be called using their
  keyword arguments.

  .. code-block:: python

    def someFunction(a,(b,c)):
        return a, b, c

    someFunction(a = 1, **{".1" : (2,3)})

- Compatibility: Generators with Python3.4 or higher now also have a ``__del__``
  attribute, and therefore properly participate in finalization. This should
  improve their interactions with garbage collection reference cycles, although
  no issues had been observed so far.

- Windows: Was outputting command line arguments debug information at program
  start. `Issue#284 <http://bugs.nuitka.net/issue284>`__. Fixed in 0.5.17.1
  already.

Optimization
------------

- Code generated for parameter parsing is now a *lot* less verbose. Python level
  loops and conditionals to generate code for each variable has been replaced
  with C level generic code. This will speed up the backend compilation by a
  lot.

- Function calls with constant arguments were speed up specifically, as their
  call is now fully prepared, and yet using less code. Variable arguments are
  also faster, and all defaulted arguments are also much faster. Method calls
  are not affected by these improvements though.

- Nested argument functions now have a quick call entry point as well, making
  them faster to call too.

- The ``slice`` built-in, and internal creation of slices (e.g. in
  re-formulations of Python3 slices as subscripts) cannot raise. `Issue#262
  <http://bugs.nuitka.net/issue262>`__.

- Standalone: Avoid inclusion of bytecode of ``unittest.test``,
  ``sqlite3.test``, ``distutils.test``, and ``ensurepip``. These are not needed,
  but simply bloat the amount of bytecode used on e.g. MacOS. `Issue#272
  <http://bugs.nuitka.net/issue272>`__.

- Speed up compilation with Nuitka itself by avoid to copying and constructing
  variable lists as much as possible using an always accurate variable registry.

Cleanups
--------

- Nested argument functions of Python2 are now re-formulated into a wrapping
  function that directly calls the actual function body with the unpacking of
  nested arguments done in nodes explicitly. This allows for better optimization
  and checks of these steps and potential in-lining of these functions too.

- Unified slice object creation and built-in ``slice`` nodes, these were two
  distinct nodes before.

- The code generation for all statement kinds is now done via dispatching from
  a dictionary instead of long ``elif`` chains.

- Named nodes more often consistently, e.g. all loop related nodes start with
  ``Loop`` now, making them easier to group.

- Parameter specifications got simplified to work without variables where it is
  possible.

Organizational
--------------

- Nuitka is now available on the social code platforms gitlab as well.

Summary
-------

Long standing weaknesses have been addressed in this release, also quite a few
structural cleanups have been performed, e.g. strengthening the role of the
variable registry to always be accurate, is groundlaying to further improvement
of optimization.

However, this release cycle was mostly dedicated to performance of the actual
compilation, and more accurate information was needed to e.g. not search for
information that should be instant.

Upcoming releases will focus on usability issues and further optimization, it
was nice however to see speedups of created code even from these scalability
improvements.


Nuitka Release 0.5.17
=====================

This release is a major feature release, as it adds full support for Python3.5
and its coroutines. In addition, in order to properly support coroutines, the
generator implementation got enhanced. On top of that, there is the usual range
of corrections.

Bug Fixes
---------

- Windows: Command line arguments that are unicode strings were not properly
  working.

- Compatibility: Fix, only the code object attached to exceptions contained all
  variable names, but not the one of the function object.

- Python3: Support for virtualenv on Windows was using non-portable code and
  therefore failing. `Issue#266 <http://bugs.nuitka.net/issue266>`__.

- The tree displayed with ``--display-tree`` duplicated all functions and did
  not resolve source lines for functions. It also displayed unused functions,
  which is not helpful.

- Generators with parameters leaked C level memory for each instance of them
  leading to memory bloat for long running programs that use a lot of
  generators. Fixed in 0.5.16.1 already.

- Don't drop positional arguments when called with ``--run``, also make it an
  error if they are present without that option.

New Features
------------

- Added full support for Python3.5, coroutines work now too.

Optimization
------------

- Optimized frame access of generators to not use both a local frame variable
  and the frame object stored in the generator object itself. This gave about
  1% speed up to setting them up.

- Avoid having multiple code objects for functions that can raise and have
  local variables. Previously one code object would be used to create the
  function (with parameter variable names only) and when raising an exception,
  another one would be used (with all local variable names). Creating them both
  at start-up was wasteful and also needed two tuples to be created, thus more
  constants setup code.

- The entry point for generators is now shared code instead of being generated
  for each one over and over. This should make things more cache local and also
  results in less generated C code.

- When creating frame codes, avoid working with strings, but use proper emission
  for less memory churn during code generation.

Organizational
--------------

- Updated the key for the Debian/Ubuntu repositories to remain valid for 2 more
  years.

- Added support for Fedora 23.

- MinGW32 is no more supported, use MinGW64 in the 32 bits variant, which has
  less issues.

Cleanups
--------

- Detecting function type ahead of times, allows to handle generators different
  from normal functions immediately.

- Massive removal of code duplication between normal functions and generator
  functions. The later are now normal functions creating generator objects,
  which makes them much more lightweight.

- The ``return`` statement in generators is now immediately set to the proper
  node as opposed to doing this in variable closure phase only. We can now use
  the ahead knowledge of the function type.

- The ``nonlocal`` statement is now immediately checked for syntax errors as
  opposed to doing that only in variable closure phase.

- The name of contraction making functions is no longer skewed to empty, but
  the real thing instead. The code name is solved differently now.

- The ``local_locals`` mode for function node was removed, it was always true
  ever since Python2 list contractions stop using pseudo functions.

- The outline nodes allowed to provide a body when creating them, although
  creating that body required using the outline node already to create temporary
  variables. Removed that argument.

- Removed PyLint false positive annotations no more needed for PyLint 1.5 and
  solved some TODOs.

- Code objects are now mostly created from specs (not yet complete) which are
  attached and shared between statement frames and function creations nodes, in
  order to have less guess work to do.

Tests
-----

- Added the CPython3.5 test suite.

- Updated generated doctests to fix typos and use common code in all CPython
  test suites.

Summary
-------

This release continues to address technical debt. Adding support for Python3.5
was the major driving force, while at the same time removing obstacles to the
changes that were needed for coroutine support.

With Python3.5 sorted out, it will be time to focus on general optimization
again, but there is more technical debt related to classes, so the cleanup
has to continue.


Nuitka Release 0.5.16
=====================

This is a maintenance release, largely intended to put out improved support for
new platforms and minor corrections. It should improve the speed for standalone
mode, and compilation in general for some use cases, but this is mostly to clean
up open ends.

Bug Fixes
---------

- Fix, the ``len`` built-in could give false values for dictionary and set
  creations with the same element.

  .. code-block:: python

     # This was falsely optimized to 2 even if "a is b and a == b" was true.
     len({a, b})

- Python: Fix, the ``gi_running`` attribute of generators is no longer an
  ``int``, but ``bool`` instead.

- Python3: Fix, the ``int`` built-in with two arguments, value and base, raised
  ``UnicodeDecodeError`` instead of ``ValueError`` for illegal bytes given as
  value.

- Python3: Using ``tokenize.open`` to read source code, instead of reading
  manually and decoding from ``tokenize.detect_encoding``, this handles corner
  cases more compatible.

- Fix, the PyLint warnings plug-in could crash in some cases, make sure it's
  more robust.

- Windows: Fix, the combination of AnaConda Python, MinGW 64 bits and mere
  acceleration was not working. `Issue#254 <http://bugs.nuitka.net/issue254>`__.

- Standalone: Preserve not only namespace packages created by ``.pth`` files,
  but also make the imports done by them. This makes it more compatible with
  uses of it in Fedora 22.

- Standalone: The extension modules could be duplicated, turned this into an
  error and cache finding them during compile time and during early import
  resolution to avoid duplication.

- Standalone: Handle "not found" from ``ldd`` output, on some systems not all
  the libraries wanted are accessible for every library.

- Python3.5: Fixed support for namespace packages, these were not yet working
  for that version yet.

- Python3.5: Fixes lack of support for unpacking in normal ``tuple``, ``list``,
  and ``set`` creations.

  .. code-block:: python

      [*a] # this has become legal in 3.5 and now works too.

  Now also gives compatible ``SyntaxError`` for earlier versions. Python2 was
  good already.

- Python3.5: Fix, need to reduce compiled functions to ``__qualname__`` value,
  rather than just ``__name__`` or else pickling methods doesn't work.

- Python3.5: Fix, added ``gi_yieldfrom`` attribute to generator objects.

- Windows: Fixed harmless warnings for Visual Studio 2015 in ``--debug`` mode.

Optimization
------------

- Re-formulate ``exec`` and ``eval`` to default to ``globals()`` as the default
  for the locals dictionary in modules.

- The ``try`` node was making a description of nodes moved to the outside when
  shrinking its scope, which was using a lot of time, just to not be output, now
  these can be postponed.

- Refactored how freezing of bytecode works. Uncompiled modules are now explicit
  nodes too, and in the registry. We only have one or the other of it, avoiding
  to compile both.

Tests
-----

- When ``strace`` or ``dtruss`` are not found, given proper error message, so
  people know what to do.

- The doc tests extracted and then generated for CPython3 test suites were not
  printing the expressions of the doc test, leading to largely decreased test
  coverage here.

- The CPython 3.4 test suite is now also using common runner code, and avoids
  ignoring all Nuitka warnings, instead more white listing was added.

- Started to run CPython 3.5 test suite almost completely, but coroutines are
  blocking some parts of that, so these tests that use this feature are
  currently skipped.

- Removed more CPython tests that access the network and are generally useless
  to testing Nuitka.

- When comparing outputs, normalize typical temporary file names used on posix
  systems.

- Coverage tests have made some progress, and some changes were made due to its
  results.

- Added test to cover too complex code module of ``idna`` module.

- Added Python3.5 only test for unpacking variants.

Cleanups
--------

- Prepare plug-in interface to allow suppression of import warnings to access
  the node doing it, making the import node is accessible.

- Have dedicated class function body object, which is a specialization of the
  function body node base class. This allowed removing class specific code from
  that class.

- The use of "win_target" as a scons parameter was useless. Make more consistent
  use of it as a flag indicator in the scons file.

- Compiled types were mixing uses of ``compiled_`` prefixes, something with
  a space, sometimes with an underscore.

Organizational
--------------

- Improved support for Python3.5 missing compatibility with new language
  features.

- Updated the Developer Manual with changes that SSA is now a fact.

- Added Python3.5 Windows MSI downloads.

- Added repository for Ubuntu Wily (15.10) for download. Removed Ubuntu Utopic
  package download, no longer supported by Ubuntu.

- Added repository with RPM packages for Fedora 22.

Summary
-------

So this release is mostly to lower the technical debt incurred that holds it
back from supporting making more interesting changes. Upcoming releases may
have continue that trend for some time.

This release is mostly about catching up with Python3.5, to make sure we did
not miss anything important. The new function body variants will make it easier
to implement coroutines, and help with optimization and compatibility problems
that remain for Python3 classes.

Ultimately it will be nice to require a lot less checks for when function
in-line is going to be acceptable. Also code generation will need a continued
push to use the new structure in preparation for making type specific code
generation a reality.


Nuitka Release 0.5.15
=====================

This release enables SSA based optimization, the huge leap, not so much in terms
of actual performance increase, but for now making the things possible that will
allow it.

This has been in the making literally for years. Over and over, there was just
"one more thing" needed. But now it's there.

The release includes much stuff, and there is a perspective on the open tasks
in the summary, but first out to the many details.

Bug Fixes
---------

- Standalone: Added implicit import for ``reportlab`` package configuration
  dynamic import. Fixed in 0.5.14.1 already.

- Standalone: Fix, compilation of the ``ctypes`` module could happen for some
  import patterns, and then prevented the distribution to contain all necessary
  libraries. Now it is made sure to not include compiled and frozen form both.
  `Issue#241 <http://bugs.nuitka.net/issue241>`__. Fixed in 0.5.14.1 already.

- Fix, compilation for conditional statements where the boolean check on the
  condition cannot raise, could fail compilation. `Issue#240
  <http://bugs.nuitka.net/issue240>`__. Fixed in 0.5.14.2 already.

- Fix, the ``__import__`` built-in was making static optimization assuming
  compile time constants to be strings, which in the error case they are not,
  which was crashing the compiler.  `Issue#240
  <http://bugs.nuitka.net/issue245>`__.

  .. code-block:: python

      __import__(("some.module",)) # tuples don't work

  This error became only apparent, because now in some cases, Nuitka forward
  propagates values.

- Windows: Fix, when installing Python2 only for the user, the detection of it
  via registry failed as it was only searching system key. This was `a github
  pull request <https://github.com/kayhayen/Nuitka/pull/8>`__. Fixed in
  0.5.14.3 already.

- Some modules have extremely complex expressions requiring too deep recursion
  to work on all platforms. These modules are now included entirely as bytecode
  fallback. `Issue#240 <http://bugs.nuitka.net/issue240>`__.

- The standard library may contain broken code due to installation mistakes. We
  have to ignore their ``SyntaxError``. `Issue#244
  <http://bugs.nuitka.net/issue244>`__.

- Fix, pickling compiled methods was failing with the wrong kind of error,
  because they should not implement ``__reduce__``, but only ``__deepcopy__``.
  `Issue#219 <http://bugs.nuitka.net/issue219>`__.

- Fix, when running under ``wine``, the check for scons binary was fooled by
  existance of ``/usr/bin/scons``. `Issue#251
  <http://bugs.nuitka.net/issue251>`__.

New Features
------------

- Added experimental support for Python3.5, coroutines don't work yet, but it
  works perfectly as a 3.4 replacement.

- Added experimental Nuitka plug-in framework, and use it for the packaging of
  Qt plugins in standalone mode. The API is not yet stable nor polished.

- New option ``--debugger`` that makes ``--run`` execute directly in ``gdb``
  and gives a stack trace on crash.

- New option ``--profile`` executes compiled binary and outputs measured
  performance with ``vmprof``. This is work in progress and not functional
  yet.

- Started work on ``--graph`` to render the SSA state into diagrams. This is
  work in progress and not functional yet.

- Plug-in framework added. Not yet ready for users. Working ``PyQt4`` and
  ``PyQt5`` plug-in support. Experimental Windows ``multiprocessing`` support.
  Experimental PyLint warnings disable support. More to come.

- Added support for AnaConda accelerated mode on MacOS by modifying the rpath
  to the Python DLL.

- Added experimental support for ``multiprocessing`` on Windows, which needs
  money patching of the module to support compiled methods.


Optimization
------------

- The SSA analysis is now enabled by default, eliminating variables that are
  not shared, and can be forward propagated. This is currently limited mostly
  to compile time constants, but things won't remain that way.

- Code generation for many constructs now takes into account if a specific
  operation can raise or not. If e.g. an attribute look-up is known to not
  raise, then that is now decided by the node the looked is done to, and then
  more often can determine this, or even directly the value.

- Calls to C-API that we know cannot raise, no longer check, but merely assert
  the result.

- For attribute look-up and other operations that might be known to not raise,
  we now only assert that it succeeds.

- Built-in loop-ups cannot fail, merely assert that.

- Creation of built-in exceptions never raises, merely assert that too.

- More Python operation slots now have their own computations and some of these
  gained overloads for more compile time constant optimization.

- When taking an iterator cannot raise, this is now detected more often.

- The ``try``/``finally`` construct is now represented by duplicating the
  final block into all kinds of handlers (``break``, ``continue``, ``return``,
  or ``except``) and optimized separately. This allows for SSA to trace values
  more correctly.

- The ``hash`` built-in now has dedicated node and code generation too. This is
  mostly intended to represent the side effects of dictionary look-up, but
  gives more compact and faster code too.

- Type ``type`` built-in cannot raise and has no side effect.

- Speed improvement for in-place float operations for ``+=`` and ``*=``, as
  these will be common cases.

Tests
-----

- Made the construct based testing executable with Python3.

- Removed warnings using the new PyLint warnings plug-in for the reflected
  test. Nuitka now uses the PyLint annotations to not warn. Also do not go
  into PyQt for reflected test, not needed. Many Python3 improvements for
  cases where there are differences to report.

- The optimization tests no longer use 2to3 anymore, made the tests portable
  to all versions.

- Checked more in-place operations for speed.

Organizational
--------------

- Many improvements to the coverage taking. We can hope to see public data from
  this, some improvements were triggered from this already, but full runs of the
  test suite with coverage data collection are yet to be done.

Summary
-------

The release includes many important new directions. Coverage analysis will be
important to remain certain of test coverage of Nuitka itself. This is mostly
done, but needs more work to complete.

Then the graphing surely will help us to debug and understand code examples. So
instead of tracing, and reading stuff, we should visualize things, to more
clearly see, how things evolve under optimization iteration, and where exactly
one thing goes wrong. This will be improved as it proves necessary to do just
that. So far, this has been rare. Expect this to become end user capable with
time. If only to allow you to understand why Nuitka won't optimize code of
yours, and what change of Nuitka it will need to improve.

The comparative performance benchmarking is clearly the most important thing to
have for users. It deserves to be the top priority. Thanks to the PyPy tool
``vmprof``, we may already be there on the data taking side, but the presenting
and correlation part, is still open and a fair bit of work. It will be most
important to empower users to make competent performance bug reports, now that
Nuitka enters the phase, where these things matter.

As this is a lot of ground to cover. More than ever. We can make this compiler,
but only if you help, it will arrive in your life time.


Nuitka Release 0.5.14
=====================

This release is an intermediate step towards value propagation, which is not
considered ready for stable release yet. The major point is the elimination
of the ``try``/``finally`` expressions, as they are problems to SSA. The
``try``/``finally`` statement change is delayed.

There are also a lot of bug fixes, and enhancements to code generation, as well
as major cleanups of code base.

Bug Fixes
---------

- Python3: Added support assignments trailing star assignment.

  .. code-block:: python

      *a, b = 1, 2

  This raised ``ValueError`` before.

- Python3: Properly detect illegal double star assignments.

  .. code-block:: python

      *a, *b = c

- Python3: Properly detect the syntax error to star assign from non-tuple/list.

  .. code-block:: python

      *a = 1

- Python3.4: Fixed a crash of the binary when copying dictionaries with split
  tables received as star arguments.

- Python3: Fixed reference loss, when using ``raise a from b`` where ``b`` was
  an exception instance. Fixed in 0.5.13.8 already.

- Windows: Fix, the flag ``--disable-windows-console`` was not properly handled
  for MinGW32 run time resulting in a crash.

- Python2.7.10: Was not recognizing this as a 2.7.x variant and therefore not
  applying minor version compatibility levels properly.

- Fix, when choosing to have frozen source references, code objects were not
  use the same value as ``__file__`` did for its filename.

- Fix, when re-executing itself to drop the ``site`` module, make sure we find
  the same file again, and not according to the ``PYTHONPATH`` changes coming
  from it. `Issue#223 <http://bugs.nuitka.net/issue223>`__. Fixed in 0.5.13.4
  already.

- Enhanced code generation for ``del variable`` statements, where it's clear
  that the value must be assigned.

- When pressing CTRL-C, the stack traces from both Nuitka and Scons were given,
  we now avoid the one from Scons.

- Fix, the dump from ``--xml`` no longer contains functions that have become
  unused during analysis.

- Standalone: Creating or running programs from inside unicode paths was not
  working on Windows. `Issue#231 <http://bugs.nuitka.net/issue231>`__
  `Issue#229 <http://bugs.nuitka.net/issue229>`__ and.
  Fixed in 0.5.13.7 already.

- Namespace package support was not yet complete, importing the parent of a
  package was still failing. `Issue#230 <http://bugs.nuitka.net/issue231>`__.
  Fixed in 0.5.13.7 already.

- Python2.6: Compatibility for exception check messages enhanced with newest
  minor releases.

- Compatibility: The ``NameError`` in classes needs to say ``global name`` and
  not just ``name`` too.

- Python3: Fixed creation of XML representation, now done without ``lxml`` as
  it doesn't support needed features on that version. Fixed in 0.5.13.5 already.

- Python2: Fix, when creating code for the largest negative constant to still
  fit into ``int``, that was only working in the main module. `Issue#228
  <http://bugs.nuitka.net/issue228>`__. Fixed in 0.5.13.5 already.

- Compatibility: The ``print`` statement raised an assertion on unicode objects
  that could not be encoded with ``ascii`` codec.

New Features
------------

- Added support for Windows 10.

- Followed changes for Python 3.5 beta 2. Still only usable as a Python 3.4
  replacement, no new features.

- Using a self compiled Python running from the source tree is now supported.

- Added support for ``AnaConda`` Python distribution. As it doesn't install
  the Python DLL, we copy it along for acceleration mode.

- Added support for Visual Studio 2015. `Issue#222
  <http://bugs.nuitka.net/issue222>`__. Fixed in 0.5.13.3 already.

- Added support for self compiled Python versions running from build tree,
  this is intended to help debug things on Windows.

Optimization
------------

- Function in-lining is now present in the code, but still disabled, because it
  needs more changes in other areas, before we can generally do it.

- Trivial outlines, result of re-formulations or function in-lining, are now
  in-lined, in case they just return an expression.

- The re-formulation for ``or`` and ``and`` has been giving up, eliminating the
  use of a ``try``/``finally`` expression, at the cost of dedicated boolean
  nodes and code generation for these.

  This saves around 8% of compile time memory for Nuitka, and allows for faster
  and more complete optimization, and gets rid of a complicated structure for
  analysis.

- When a frame is used in an exception, its locals are detached. This was done
  more often than necessary and even for frames that are not necessary our own
  ones. This will speed up some exception cases.

- When the default arguments, or the keyword default arguments (Python3) or
  the annotations (Python3) were raising an exception, the function definition
  is now replaced with the exception, saving a code generation. This happens
  frequently with Python2/Python3 compatible code guarded by version checks.

- The SSA analysis for loops now properly traces "break" statement situations
  and merges the post-loop situation from all of them. This significantly
  allows for and improves optimization of code following the loop.

- The SSA analysis of ``try``/``finally`` statements has been greatly enhanced.
  The handler for ``finally`` is now optimized for exception raise and no
  exception raise individually, as well as for ``break``, ``continue`` and
  ``return`` in the tried code. The SSA analysis for after the statement is now
  the result of merging these different cases, should they not abort.

- The code generation for `del` statements is now taking advantage should there
  be definite knowledge of previous value. This speed them up slightly.

- The SSA analysis of `del` statements now properly decided if the statement
  can raise or not, allowing for more optimization.

- For list contractions, the re-formulation was enhanced using the new outline
  construct instead of a pseudo function, leading to better analysis and code
  generation.

- Comparison chains are now re-formulated into outlines too, allowing for better
  analysis of them.

- Exceptions raised in function creations, e.g. in default values, are now
  propagated, eliminating the function's code. This happens most often with
  Python2/Python3 in branches. On the other hand, function creations that
  cannot are also annotated now.

- Closure variables that become unreferenced outside of the function become
  normal variables leading to better tracing and code generation for them.

- Function creations cannot raise except their defaults, keyword defaults or
  annotations do.

- Built-in references can now be converted to strings at compile time, e.g.
  when printed.

Organizational
--------------

- Removed gitorious mirror of the git repository, they shut down.

- Make it more clear in the documentation that Python2 is needed at compile time
  to create Python3 executables.

Cleanups
--------

- Moved more parts of code generation to their own modules, and used registry
  for code generation for more expression kinds.

- Unified ``try``/``except`` and ``try``/``finally`` into a single construct
  that handles both through ``try``/``except``/``break``/``continue``/``return``
  semantics. Finally is now solved via duplicating the handler into cases
  necessary.

  No longer are nodes annotated with information if they need to publish the
  exception or not, this is now all done with the dedicated nodes.

- The ``try``/``finally`` expressions have been replaced with outline function
  bodies, that instead of side effect statements, are more like functions with
  return values, allowing for easier analysis and dedicated code generation of
  much lower complexity.

- No more "tolerant" flag for release nodes, we now decide this fully based on
  SSA information.

- Added helper for assertions that code flow does not reach certain positions,
  e.g. a function must return or raise, aborting statements do not continue and
  so on.

- To keep cloning of code parts as simple as possible, the limited use of
  ``makeCloneAt`` has been changed to a new ``makeClone`` which produces
  identical copies, which is what we always do. And a generic cloning based
  on "details" has been added, requiring to make constructor arguments and
  details complete and consistent.

- The re-formulation code helpers have been improved to be more convenient at
  creating nodes.

- The old ``nuitka.codegen`` module ``Generator`` was still used for many
  things. These now all got moved to appropriate code generation modules, and
  their users got updated, also moving some code generator functions in the
  process.

- The module ``nuitka.codegen.CodeTemplates`` got replaces with direct uses
  of the proper topic module from ``nuitka.codegen.templates``, with some
  more added, and their names harmonized to be more easily recognizable.

- Added more assertions to the generated code, to aid bug finding.

- The autoformat now sorts pylint markups for increased consistency.

- Releases no longer have a ``tolerant`` flag, this was not needed anymore
  as we use SSA.

- Handle CTRL-C in scons code preventing per job messages that are not helpful
  and avoid tracebacks from scons, also remove more unused tools like ``rpm``
  from out in-line copy.

Tests
-----

- Added the CPython3.4 test suite.

- The CPython3.2, CPython3.3, and CPython3.4 test suite now run with Python2
  giving the same errors. Previously there were a few specific errors, some
  with line numbers, some with different ``SyntaxError`` be raised, due to
  different order of checks.

  This increases the coverage of the exception raising tests somewhat.

- Also the CPython3.x test suites now all pass with debug Python, as does the
  CPython 2.6 test suite with 2.6 now.

- Added tests to cover all forms of unpacking assignments supported in Python3,
  to be sure there are no other errors unknown to us.

- Started to document the reference count tests, and to make it more robust
  against SSA optimization. This will take some time and is work in progress.

- Made the compile library test robust against modules that raise a syntax
  error, checking that Nuitka does the same.

- Refined more tests to be directly execuable with Python3, this is an ongoing
  effort.

Summary
-------

This release is clearly major. It represents a huge step forward for Nuitka as
it improves nearly every aspect of code generation and analysis. Removing the
``try``/``finally`` expression nodes proved to be necessary in order to even
have the correct SSA in their cases. Very important optimization was blocked by
it.

Going forward, the ``try``/``finally`` statements will be removed and dead
variable elimination will happen, which then will give function inlining. This
is expected to happen in one of the next releases.

This release is a consolidation of 8 hotfix releases, and many refactorings
needed towards the next big step, which might also break things, and for that
reason is going to get its own release cycle.


Nuitka Release 0.5.13
=====================

This release contains the first use of SSA for value propagation and massive
amounts of bug fixes and optimization. Some of the bugs that were delivered
as hotfixes, were only revealed when doing the value propagation as they still
could apply to real code.

Bug Fixes
---------

- Fix, relative imports in packages were not working with absolute imports
  enabled via future flags. Fixed in 0.5.12.1 already.

- Loops were not properly degrading knowledge from inside the loop at loop
  exit, and therefore this could have lead missing checks and releases in code
  generation for cases, for ``del`` statements in the loop body. Fixed in
  0.5.12.1 already.

- The ``or`` and ``and`` re-formulation could trigger false assertions, due to
  early releases for compatibility. Fixed in 0.5.12.1 already.

- Fix, optimizion of calls of constant objects (always an exception), crashed
  the compiler. This corrects `Issue#202 <http://bugs.nuitka.net/issue202>`__.
  Fixed in 0.5.12.2 already.

- Standalone: Added support for ``site.py`` installations with a leading ``def``
  or ``class`` statement, which is defeating our attempt to patch ``__file__``
  for it. This corrects `Issue#189 <http://bugs.nuitka.net/issue189>`__.

- Compatibility: In full compatibility mode, the tracebacks of ``or`` and
  ``and`` expressions are now as wrong as they are in CPython. Does not apply
  to ``--improved`` mode.

- Standalone: Added missing dependency on ``QtGui`` by ``QtWidgets`` for PyQt5.

- MacOS: Improved parsing of ``otool`` output to avoid duplicate entries, which
  can also be entirely wrong in the case of Qt plugins at least.

- Avoid relative paths for main program with file reference mode ``original``,
  as it otherwise changes as the file moves.

- MinGW: The created modules depended on MinGW to be in ``PATH`` for their
  usage. This is no longer necessary, as we now link these libraries statically
  for modules too.

- Windows: For modules, the option ``--run`` to immediately load the modules
  had been broken for a while.

- Standalone: Ignore Windows DLLs that were attempted to be loaded, but then
  failed to load. This happens e.g. when both PySide and PyQt are installed,
  and could cause the dreaded conflicting DLLs message. The DLL loaded in error
  is now ignored, which avoids this.

- MinGW: The resource file used might be empty, in which case it doesn't get
  created, avoiding an error due to that.

- MinGW: Modules can now be created again. The run time relative code uses an
  API that is WinXP only, and MinGW failed to find it without guidance.


Optimization
------------

- Make direct calls out of called function creations. Initially this applies
  to lambda functions only, but it's expected to become common place in coming
  releases. This is now 20x faster than CPython.

  .. code-block:: python

      # Nuitka avoids creating a function object, parsing function arguments:
      (lambda x:x)(something)

- Propagate assignments from non-mutable constants forward based on SSA
  information. This is the first step of using SSA for real compile time
  optimization.

- Specialized the creation of call nodes at creation, avoiding to have all kinds
  be the most flexible form (keyword and plain arguments), but instead only what
  kind of call they really are. This saves lots of memory, and makes the tree
  faster to visit.

- Added support for optimizing the ``slice`` built-in with compile time constant
  arguments to constants. The re-formulation for slices in Python3 uses these a
  lot. And the lack of this optimization prevented a bunch of optimization in
  this area. For Python2 the built-in is optimized too, but not as important
  probably.

- Added support for optimizing ``isinstance`` calls with compile time constant
  arguments. This avoids static exception raises in the ``exec`` re-formulation
  which tests for ``file`` type, and then optimization couldn't tell that a
  ``str`` is not a ``file`` instance. Now it can.

- Lower in-place operations on immutable types to normal operations. This will
  allow to compile time compute these more accurately.

- The re-formulation of loops puts the loop condition as a conditional
  statement with break. The ``not`` that needs to apply was only added in
  later optimization, leading to unnecessary compile time efforts.

- Removed per variable trace visit from optimization, removing useless code and
  compile time overhead. We are going to optimize things by making decision in
  assignment and reference nodes based on forward looking statements using the
  last trace collection.

New Features
------------

- Added experimental support for Python 3.5, which seems to be passing the
  test suites just fine. The new ``@`` matrix multiplicator operators are
  not yet supported though.

- Added support for patching source on the fly. This is used to work around
  a (now fixed) issue with ``numexpr.cpuinfo`` making type checks with the
  ``is`` operation, about the only thing we cannot detect.

Organizational
--------------

- Added repository for Ubuntu Vivid (15.04) for download. Removed Ubuntu Saucy
  and Ubuntu Raring package downloads, these are no longer supported by Ubuntu.

- Added repository for Debian Stretch, after Jessie release.

- Make it more clear in the documentation that in order to compile Python3, a
  Python2 is needed to execute Scons, but that the end result is a Python3
  binary.

- The PyLint checker tool now can operate on directories given on the command
  line, and whitelists an error that is Windows only.

Cleanups
--------

- Split up standalone code further, moving ``depends.exe`` handling to a
  separate module.

- Reduced code complexity of scons interface.

- Cleaned up where trace collection is being done. It was partially still done
  inside the collection itself instead in the owner.

- In case of conflicting DLLs for standalone mode, these are now output with
  nicer formatting, that makes it easy to recognize what is going on.

- Moved code to fetch ``depends.exe`` to dedicated module, so it's not as much
  in the way of standalone code.

Tests
-----

- Made ``BuiltinsTest`` directly executable with Python3.

- Added construct test to demonstrate the speed up of direct lambda calls.

- The deletion of ``@test`` for the CPython test suite is more robust now,
  esp. on Windows, the symbolic links are now handled.

- Added test to cover ``or`` usage with in-place assignment.

- Cover local relative ``import from .`` with ``absolute_import`` future flag
  enabled.

- Again, more basic tests are now directly executable with Python3.

Summary
-------

This release is major due to amount of ground covered. The reduction in memory
usage of Nuitka itself (the C++ compiler will still use much memory) is very
massive and an important aspect of scalability too.

Then the SSA changes are truly the first sign of major improvements to come. In
their current form, without eliminating dead assignments, the full advantage is
not taken yet, but the next releases will do this, and that's a major milestone
to Nuitka.

The other optimization mostly stem from looking at things closer, and trying
to work towards function in-lining, for which we are making a lot of progress
now.


Nuitka Release 0.5.12
=====================

This release contains massive amounts of corrections for long standing issues
in the import recursion mechanism, as well as for standalone issues now visible
after the ``__file__`` and ``__path__`` values have changed to become runtime
dependent values.

Bug Fixes
---------

- Fix, the ``__path__`` attribute for packages was still the original filename's
  directory, even in file reference mode was ``runtime``.

- The use of ``runtime`` as default file reference mode for executables, even if
  not in standalone mode, was making acceleration harder than necessary. Changed
  to ``original`` for that case. Fixed in 0.5.11.1 already.

- The constant value for the smallest ``int`` that is not yet a ``long`` is
  created using ``1`` due to C compiler limitations, but ``1`` was not yet
  initialized properly, if this was a global constant, i.e. used in multiple
  modules. Fixed in 0.5.11.2 already.

- Standalone: Recent fixes around ``__path__`` revealed issues with PyWin32,
  where modules from ``win32com.shell`` were not properly recursed to. Fixed in
  0.5.11.2 already.

- The importing of modules with the same name as a built-in module inside a
  package falsely assumed these were the built-ins which need not exist, and
  then didn't recurse into them. This affected standalone mode the most, as
  the module was then missing entirely. This corrects `Issue#178
  <http://bugs.nuitka.net/issue178>`__.

  .. code-block:: python

      # Inside "x.y" module:
      import x.y.exceptions

- Similarily, the importing of modules with the same name as standard library
  modules could go wrong. This corrects `Issue#184
  <http://bugs.nuitka.net/issue184>`__.

  .. code-block:: python

      # Inside "x.y" module:
      import x.y.types

- Importing modules on Windows and MacOS was not properly checking the checking
  the case, making it associate wrong modules from files with mismatching case.
  This corrects `Issue#188 <http://bugs.nuitka.net/issue188>`__.

- Standalone: Importing with ``from __future__ import absolute_import`` would
  prefer relative imports still. This corrects
  `Issue#187 <http://bugs.nuitka.net/issue188>`__.

- Python3: Code generation for ``try``/``return expr``/``finally`` could loose
  exceptions when ``expr`` raised an exception, leading to a ``RuntimeError``
  for ``NULL`` return value. The real exception was lost.

- Lambda expressions that were directly called with star arguments caused the
  compiler to crash.

  .. code-block:: python

      (lambda *args:args)(*args) # was crashing Nuitka

New Optimization
----------------

- Focusing on compile time memory usage, cyclic dependencies of trace merges
  that prevented them from being released, even when replaced were removed.

- More memory efficient updating of global SSA traces, reducing memory usage
  during optimization by ca. 50%.

- Code paths that cannot and therefore must not happen are now more clearly
  indicated to the backend compiler, allowing for slightly better code to
  be generated by it, as it can tell that certain code flows need not be
  merged.

New Features
------------

- Standalone: On systems, where ``.pth`` files inject Python packages at launch,
  these are now detected, and taking into account. Previously Nuitka did not
  recognize them, due to lack of ``__init__.py`` files. These are mostly pip
  installations of e.g. ``zope.interface``.

- Added option ``--explain-imports`` to debug the import resolution code of
  Nuitka.

- Added options ``--show-memory`` to display the amount of memory used in total
  and how it's spread across the different node types during compilation.

- The option ``--trace-execution`` now also covers early program initialisation
  before any Python code runs, to ease finding bugs in this domain as well.

Organizational
--------------

- Changed default for file reference mode to ``original`` unless standalone or
  module mode are used. For mere acceleration, breaking the reading of data
  files from ``__file__`` is useless.

- Added check that the in-line copy of scons is not run with Python3, which is
  not supported. Nuitka works fine with Python3, but a Python2 is required to
  execute scons.

- Discover more kinds of Python2 installations on Linux/MacOS installations.

- Added instructions for MacOS to the download page.

Cleanups
--------

- Moved ``oset`` and ``odict`` modules which provide ordered sets and
  dictionaries into a new package ``nuitka.container`` to clean up the
  top level scope.

- Moved ``SyntaxErrors`` to ``nuitka.tree`` package, where it is used to
  format error messages.

- Moved ``nuitka.Utils`` package to ``nuitka.utils.Utils`` creating a whole
  package for utils, so as to better structure them for their purpose.

Summary
-------

This release is a major maintenance release. Support for namespace modules
injected by ``*.pth`` is a major step for new compatibility. The import logic
improvements expand the ability of standalone mode widely. Many more use cases
will now work out of the box, and less errors will be found on case insensitive
systems.

There is aside of memory issues, no new optimization though as many of these
improvements could not be delivered as hotfixes (too invasive code changes),
and should be out to the users as a stable release. Real optimization changes
have been postponed to be next release.


Nuitka Release 0.5.11
=====================

The last release represented a significant change and introduced a few
regressions, which got addressed with hot fix releases. But it also had a focus
on cleaning up open optimization issues that were postponed in the last release.

New Features
------------

- The filenames of source files as found in the ``__file__`` attribute are
  now made relative for all modes, not just standalone mode.

  This makes it possible to put data files along side compiled modules in a
  deployment. This solves `Issue#170 <http://bugs.nuitka.net/issue170>`__.

Bug Fixes
---------

- Local functions that reference themselves were not released. They now are.

  .. code-block:: python

    def someFunction():
        def f():
            f() # referencing 'f' in 'f' caused the garbage collection to fail.

  Recent changes to code generation attached closure variable values to the
  function object, so now they can be properly visited. This corrects
  `Issue#45 <http://bugs.nuitka.net/issue45>`__. Fixed in 0.5.10.1
  already.

- Python2.6: The complex constants with real or imaginary parts ``-0.0`` were
  collapsed with constants of value ``0.0``. This became more evident after
  we started to optimize the ``complex`` built-in. Fixed in 0.5.10.1 already.

  .. code-block:: python

      complex(0.0, 0.0)
      complex(-0.0, -0.0) # Could be confused with the above.

- Complex call helpers could leak references to their arguments. This was a
  regression. Fixed in 0.5.10.1 already.

- Parameter variables offered as closure variables were not properly released,
  only the cell object was, but not the value. This was a regression. Fixed in
  0.5.10.1 already.

- Compatibility: The exception type given when accessing local variable values
  not initialized in a closure taking function, needs to be ``NameError`` and
  ``UnboundLocalError`` for accesses in the providing function. Fixed in
  0.5.10.1 already.

- Fix support for "venv" on systems, where the system Python uses symbolic
  links too. This is the case on at least on Mageia Linux. Fixed in
  0.5.10.2 already.

- Python3.4: On systems where ``long`` and ``Py_ssize_t`` are different (e.g.
  Win64) iterators could be corrupted if used by uncompiled Python code. Fixed
  in 0.5.10.2 already.

- Fix, generator objects didn't release weak references to them properly. Fixed
  in 0.5.10.2 already.

- Compatiblity: The ``__closure__`` attributes of functions was so far not
  supported, and rarely missing. Recent changes made it easy to expose, so now
  it was added. This corrects `Issue#45 <http://bugs.nuitka.net/issue45>`__.

- MacOS: A linker warning about deprecated linker option ``-s`` was solved by
  removing the option.

- Compatibility: Nuitka was enforcing that the ``__doc__`` attribute to be a
  string object, and gave a misleading error message. This check must not be
  done though, ``__doc__`` can be any type in Python. This corrects `Issue#177
  <http://bugs.nuitka.net/issue177>`__.

New Optimization
----------------

- Variables that need not be shared, because the uses in closure taking
  functions were eliminated, no longer use cell objects.

- The ``try``/``except`` and ``try``/``finally`` statements now both have
  actual merging for SSA, allowing for better optimization of code behind it.

  .. code-block:: python

      def f():

          try:
              a = something()
          except:
              return 2

          # Since the above exception handling cannot continue the code flow,
          # we do not have to invalidate the trace of "a", and e.g. do not have
          # to generate code to check if it's assigned.
          return a

  Since ``try``/``finally`` is used in almost all re-formulations of complex
  Python constructs this is improving SSA application widely. The uses of
  ``try``/``except`` in user code will no longer degrade optimization and
  code generation efficiency as much as they did.

- The ``try``/``except`` statement now reduces the scope of tried block if
  possible. When no statement raised, already the handling was removed, but
  leading and trailing statements that cannot raise, were not considered.

  .. code-block:: python

      def f():

          try:
              b = 1
              a = something()
              c = 1
          except:
              return 2

  This is now optimized to.

  .. code-block:: python

      def f():

          b = 1
          try:
              a = something()
          except:
              return 2
          c = 1

  The impact may on execution speed may be marginal, but it is definitely
  going to improve the branch merging to be added later. Note that ``c`` can
  only be optimized, because the exception handler is aborting, otherwise it
  would change behaviour.

- The creation of code objects for standalone mode and now all code objects was
  creating a distinct filename object for every function in a module, despite
  them being same content. This was wasteful for module loading. Now it's done
  only once.

  Also, when having multiple modules, the code to build the run time filename
  used for code objects, was calling import logic, and doing lookups to find
  ``os.path.join`` again and again. These are now cached, speeding up the use
  of many modules as well.

Cleanups
--------

- Nuitka used to have "variable usage profiles" and still used them to decide
  if a global variable is written to, in which case, it stays away from doing
  optimization of it to built-in lookups, and later calls.

  The have been replaced by "global variable traces", which collect the traces
  to a variable across all modules and functions. While this is now only a
  replacement, and getting rid of old code, and basing on SSA, later it will
  also allow to become more correct and more optimized.

- The standalone now queries its hidden dependencies from a plugin framework,
  which will become an interface to Nuitka internals in the future.

Testing
-------

- The use of deep hashing of constants allows us to check if constants become
  mutated during the run-time of a program. This allows to discover corruption
  should we encounter it.

- The tests of CPython are now also run with Python in debug mode, but only on
  Linux, enhancing reference leak coverage.

- The CPython test parts which had been disabled due to reference cycles
  involving compiled functions, or usage of ``__closure__`` attribute, were
  reactivated.

Organizational
--------------

- Since Google Code has shutdown, it has been removed from the Nuitka git
  mirrors.

Summary
-------

This release brings exciting new optimization with the focus on the ``try``
constructs, now being done more optimal. It is also a maintenance release,
bringing out compatibility improvements, and important bug fixes, and important
usability features for the deployment of modules and packages, that further
expand the use cases of Nuitka.

The git flow had to be applied this time to get out fixes for regression bug
fixes, that the big change of the last release brought, so this is also to
consolidate these and the other corrections into a full release before making
more invasive changes.

The cleanups are leading the way to expanded SSA applied to global variable
and shared variable values as well. Already the built-in detect is now based
on global SSA information, which was an important step ahead.


Nuitka Release 0.5.10
=====================

This release has a focus on code generation optimization. Doing major changes
away from "C++-ish" code to "C-ish" code, many constructs are now faster or
got looked at and optimized.

Bug Fixes
---------

- Compatibility: The variable name in locals for the iterator provided to the
  generator expression should be ``.0``, now it is.

- Generators could leak frames until program exit, these are now properly
  freed immediately.

New Optimization
----------------

- Faster exception save and restore functions that might be in-lined by the
  backend C compiler.

- Faster error checks for many operations, where these errors are expected,
  e.g. instance attribute lookups.

- Do not create traceback and locals dictionary for frame when ``StopIteration``
  or ``GeneratorExit`` are raised. These tracebacks were wasted, as they were
  immediately released afterwards.

- Closure variables to functions and parameters of generator functions are now
  attached to the function and generator objects.

- The creation of functions with closure taking was accelerated.

- The creation and destruction of generator objects was accelerated.

- The re-formulation for in-place assignments got simplified and got faster
  doing so.

- In-place operations of ``str`` were always copying the string, even if was
  not necessary. This corrects `Issue#124 <http://bugs.nuitka.net/issue124>`__.

  .. code-block:: python

      a += b # Was not re-using the storage of "a" in case of strings

- Python2: Additions of ``int`` for Python2 are now even faster.

- Access to local variable values got slightly accelerated at the expense of
  closure variables.

- Added support for optimizing the ``complex`` built-in.

- Removing unused temporary and local variables as a result of optimization,
  these previously still allocated storage.

Cleanup
-------

- The use of C++ classes for variable objects was removed. Closure variables
  are now attached as ``PyCellObject`` to the function objects owning them.

- The use of C++ context classes for closure taking and generator parameters
  has been replaced with attaching values directly to functions and generator
  objects.

- The indentation of code template instantiations spanning multiple was not
  in all cases proper. We were using emission objects that handle it new lines
  in code and mere ``list`` objects, that don't handle them in mixed forms.
  Now only the emission objects are used.

- Some templates with C++ helper functions that had no variables got changed
  to be properly formatted templates.

- The internal API for handling of exceptions is now more consistent and used
  more efficiently.

- The printing helpers got cleaned up and moved to static code, removing any
  need for forward declaration.

- The use of ``INCREASE_REFCOUNT_X`` was removed, it got replaced with proper
  ``Py_XINCREF`` usages. The function was once required before "C-ish" lifted
  the need to do everything in one function call.

- The use of ``INCREASE_REFCOUNT`` got reduced. See above for why that is any
  good. The idea is that ``Py_INCREF`` must be good enough, and that we want
  to avoid the C function it was, even if in-lined.

- The ``assertObject`` function that checks if an object is not ``NULL`` and
  has positive reference count, i.e. is sane, got turned into a preprocessor
  macro.

- Deep hashes of constant values created in ``--debug`` mode, which cover also
  mutable values, and attempt to depend on actual content. These are checked at
  program exit for corruption. This may help uncover bugs.

Organizational
--------------

- Speedcenter has been enhanced with better graphing and has more benchmarks
  now. More work will be needed to make it useful.

- Updates to the Developer Manual, reflecting the current near finished state
  of "C-ish" code generation.

Tests
-----

- New reference count tests to cover generator expressions and their usage got
  added.

- Many new construct based tests got added, these will be used for performance
  graphing, and serve as micro benchmarks now.

- Again, more basic tests are directly executable with Python3.

Summary
-------

This is the next evolution of "C-ish" coming to pass. The use of C++ has for
all practical purposes vanished. It will remain an ongoing activity to clear
that up and become real C. The C++ classes were a huge road block to many
things, that now will become simpler. One example of these were in-place
operations, which now can be dealt with easily.

Also, lots of polishing and tweaking was done while adding construct benchmarks
that were made to check the impact of these changes. Here, generators probably
stand out the most, as some of the missed optimization got revealed and then
addressed.

Their speed increases will be visible to some programs that depend a lot on
generators.

This release is clearly major in that the most important issues got addressed,
future releases will provide more tuning and completeness, but structurally
the "C-ish" migration has succeeded, and now we can reap the benefits in the
coming releases. More work will be needed for all in-place operations to be
accelerated.

More work will be needed to complete this, but it's good that this is coming
to an end, so we can focus on SSA based optimization for the major gains to
be had.


Nuitka Release 0.5.9
====================

This release is mostly a maintenance release, bringing out minor compatibility
improvements, and some standalone improvements. Also new options to control
the recursion into modules are added.

Bug Fixes
---------

- Compatibility: Checks for iterators were using ``PyIter_Check`` which is
  buggy when running outside of Python core, because it's comparing pointers
  we don't see. Replaced with ``HAS_ITERNEXT`` helper which compares against
  the pointer as extracting for a real non-iterator object.

  .. code-block:: python

    class Iterable:
        def __init__(self):
            self.consumed = 2

        def __iter__(self):
            return Iterable()

    iter(Iterable()) # This is suppose to raise, but didn't with Nuitka

- Python3: Errors when creating class dictionaries raised by the ``__prepare__``
  dictionary (e.g. ``enum`` classes with wrong identifiers) were not immediately
  raised, but only by the ``type`` call. This was not observable, but might have
  caused issues potentially.

- Standalone MacOS: Shared libraries and extension modules didn't have their
  DLL load paths updated, but only the main binary. This is not sufficient for
  more complex programs.

- Standalone Linux: Shared libraries copied into the ``.dist`` folder were
  read-only and executing ``chrpath`` could potentially then fail. This has
  not been observed, but is a conclusion of MacOS fix.

- Standalone: When freezing standard library, the path of Nuitka and the
  current directory remained in the search path, which could lead to looking
  at the wrong files.

Organizational
--------------

- The ``getattr`` built-in is now optimized for compile time constants if
  possible, even in the presence of a ``default`` argument. This is more
  a cleanup than actually useful yet.

- The calling of ``PyCFunction`` from normal Python extension modules got
  accelerated, especially for the no or single argument cases where Nuitka
  now avoids building the tuple.

New Features
------------

- Added the option ``--recurse-pattern`` to include modules per filename, which
  for Python3 is the only way to not have them in a package automatically.

- Added the option ``--generate-c++-only`` to only generate the C++ source code
  without starting the compiler.

  Mostly used for debugging and testing coverage. In the later case we do not
  want the C++ compiler to create any binary, but only to measure what would
  have been used.

Organizational
--------------

- Renamed the debug option ``--c++-only`` to ``--recompile-c++-only`` to make
  its purpose more clear and there now is ``--generate-c++-only`` too.

Tests
-----

- Added support for taking coverage of Nuitka in a test run on a given input
  file.

- Added support for taking coverage for all Nuitka test runners, migrating them
  all to common code for searching.

- Added uniform way of reporting skipped tests, not generally used yet.


Summary
-------

This release marks progress towards having coverage testing. Recent releases
had made it clear that not all code of Nuitka is actually used at least once
in our release tests. We aim at identifying these.

Another direction was to catch cases, where Nuitka leaks exceptions or is
subject to leaked exceptions, which revealed previously unnoticed errors.

Important changes have been delayed, e.g. the closure variables will not yet
use C++ objects to share storage, but proper ``PyCellObject`` for improved
compatibility, and to approach a more "C-ish" status. These is unfinished code
that does this. And the forward propagation of values is not enabled yet
again either.

So this is an interim step to get the bug fixes and improvements accumulated
out. Expect more actual changes in the next releases.


Nuitka Release 0.5.8
====================

This release has mainly a focus on cleanups and compatibility improvements. It
also advances standalone support, and a few optimization improvements, but it
mostly is a maintenance release, attacking long standing issues.

Bug Fixes
---------

- Compatibility Windows MacOS: Fix importing on case insensitive systems.

  It was not always working properly, if there was both a package ``Something``
  and ``something``, by merit of having files ``Something/__init__.py`` and
  ``something.py``.

- Standalone: The search path was preferring system directories and therefore
  could have conflicting DLLs. `Issue#144 <http://bugs.nuitka.net/issue144>`__.

- Fix, the optimization of ``getattr`` with predictable result was crashing the
  compilation. This was a regression, fixed in 0.5.7.1 already.

- Compatibility: The name mangling inside classes also needs to be applied to
  global variables.

- Fix, proving ``clang++`` for ``CXX`` was mistakingly thinking of it as a
  ``g++`` and making version checks on it.

- Python3: Declaring ``__class__`` global is now a ``SyntaxError`` before
  Python3.4.

- Standalone Python3: Making use of module state in extension modules was not
  working properly.


New Features
------------

- The filenames of source files as found in the ``__file__`` attribute are
  now made relative in standalone mode.

  This should make it more apparent if things outside of the distribution
  folder are used, at the cost of tracebacks. Expect the default ability
  to copy the source code along in an upcoming release.

- Added experimental standalone mode support for PyQt5. At least headless mode
  should be working, plug-ins (needed for anything graphical) are not yet
  copied and will need more work.

Cleanup
-------

- No longer using ``imp.find_module`` anymore. To solve the casing issues
  we needed to make our own module finding implementation finally.

- The name mangling was handled during code generation only. Moved to tree
  building instead.

- More code generation cleanups. The compatible line numbers are now attached
  during tree building and therefore better preserved, as well as that code
  no longer polluting code generation as much.

Organizational
--------------

- No more packages for openSUSE 12.1/12.2/12.3 and Fedora 17/18/19 as requested
  by the openSUSE Build Service.

- Added RPM packages for Fedora 21 and CentOS 7 on openSUSE Build Service.

Tests
-----

- Lots of test refinements for the CPython test suites to be run continuously
  in Buildbot for both Windows and Linux.

Summary
-------

This release brings about two major changes, each with the risk to break
things.

One is that we finally started to have our own import logic, which has the risk
to cause breakage, but apparently currently rather improved compatibility. The
case issues were not fixable with standard library code.

The second one is that the ``__file__`` attributes for standalone mode is now no
longer pointing to the original install and therefore will expose missing stuff
sooner. This will have to be followed up with code to scan for missing "data"
files later on.

For SSA based optimization, there are cleanups in here, esp. the one removing
the name mangling, allowing to remove special code for class variables. This
makes the SSA tree more reliable. Hope is that the big step (forward propagation
through variables) can be made in one of the next releases.


Nuitka Release 0.5.7
====================

This release is brings a newly supported platform, bug fixes, and again lots
of cleanups.

Bug Fixes
---------

- Fix, creation of dictionary and set literals with non-hashable indexes did
  not raise an exception.

  .. code-block:: python

     {[]: None} # This is now a TypeError

New Optimization
----------------

- Calls to the ``dict`` built-in with only keyword arguments are now optimized
  to mere dictionary creations. This is new for the case of non-constant
  arguments only of course.

  .. code-block:: python

      dict(a = b, c = d)
      # equivalent to
      {"a" : b, "c" : d}


- Slice ``del`` with indexable arguments are now using optimized code that
  avoids Python objects too. This was already done for slice look-ups.

- Added support for ``bytearray`` built-in.

Organizational
--------------

- Added support for OpenBSD with fiber implementation from library, as it
  has no context support.

Cleanups
--------

- Moved slicing solutions for Python3 to the re-formulation stage. So far the
  slice nodes were used, but only at code generation time, there was made a
  distinction between Python2 and Python3 for them. Now these nodes are purely
  Python2 and slice objects are used universally for Python3.

Tests
-----

- The test runners now have common code to scan for the first file to compile,
  an implementation of the ``search`` mode. This will allow to introduce the
  ability to search for pattern matches, etc.

- More tests are directly executable with Python3.

- Added ``recurse_none`` mode to test comparison, making using extra options
  for that purpose unnecessary.

Summary
-------

This solves long standing issues with slicing and subscript not being properly
distinguished in the Nuitka code. It also contains major bug fixes that really
problematic. Due to the involved nature of these fixes they are made in this
new release.


Nuitka Release 0.5.6
====================

This release brings bug fixes, important new optimization, newly supported
platforms, and important compatibility improvements. Progress on all fronts.

Bug Fixes
---------

- Closure taking of global variables in member functions of classes that had
  a class variable of the same name was binding to the class variable as
  opposed to the module variable.

- Overwriting compiled function's ``__doc__`` attribute more than once could
  corrupt the old value, leading to crashes.
  `Issue#156 <http://bugs.nuitka.net/issue156>`__. Fixed in 0.5.5.2 already.

- Compatibility Python2: The ``exec`` statement ``execfile`` were changing
  ``locals()`` was given as an argument.

  .. code-block:: python

      def function():
         a = 1

         exec code in locals() # Cannot change local "a".
         exec code in None     # Can change local "a"
         exec code

  Previously Nuitka treated all 3 variants the same.

- Compatibility: Empty branches with a condition were reduced to only the
  condition, but they need in fact to also check the truth value:

  .. code-block:: python

      if condition:
          pass
      # must be treated as
      bool(condition)
      # and not (bug)
      condition

- Detection of Windows virtualenv was not working properly. Fixed in 0.5.5.2
  already.

- Large enough constants structures are now unstreamed via ``marshal`` module,
  avoiding large codes being generated with no point. Fixed in 0.5.5.2 already.

- Windows: Pressing CTRL-C gave two stack traces, one from the re-execution of
  Nuitka which was rather pointless. Fixed in 0.5.5.1 already.

- Windows: Searching for virtualenv environments didn't terminate in all cases.
  Fixed in 0.5.5.1 already.

- During installation from PyPI with Python3 versions, there were errors given
  for the Python2 only scons files.
  `Issue#153 <http://bugs.nuitka.net/issue153>`__. Fixed in 0.5.5.3 already.

- Fix, the arguments of ``yield from`` expressions could be leaked.

- Fix, closure taking of a class variable could have in a sub class where the
  module variable was meant.

  .. code-block:: python

      var = 1

      class C:
         var = 2

         class D:
            def f():
               # was C.var, now correctly addressed top level var
               return var

- Fix, setting ``CXX`` environment variable because the installed gcc has too
  low version, wasn't affecting the version check at all.

- Fix, on Debian/Ubuntu with ``hardening-wrapper`` installed the version check
  was always failing, because these report a shortened version number to Scons.

New Optimization
----------------

- Local variables that must be assigned also have no side effects, making use
  of SSA. This allows for a host of optimization to be applied to them as
  well, often yielding simpler access/assign code, and discovering in more
  cases that frames are not necessary.

- Micro optimization to ``dict`` built-in for simpler code generation.

Organizational
--------------

- Added support for ARM "hard float" architecture.

- Added package for Ubuntu 14.10 for download.

- Added package for openSUSE 13.2 for download.

- Donations were used to buy a Cubox-i4 Pro. It got Debian Jessie installed
  on it, and will be used to run an even larger amount of tests.

- Made it more clear in the user documentation that the ``.exe`` suffix is used
  for all platforms, and why.

- Generally updated information in user manual and developer manual about the
  optimization status.

- Using Nikola 7.1 with external filters instead of our own, outdated branch
  for the web site.

Cleanups
--------

- PyLint clean for the first time ever. We now have a Buildbot driven test
  that this stays that way.

- Massive indentation cleanup of keyword argument calls. We have a rule to
  align the keywords, but as this was done manually, it could easily get out
  of touch. Now with a "autoformat" tool based on RedBaron, it's correct. Also,
  spacing around arguments is now automatically corrected. More to come.

- For ``exec`` statements, the coping back to local variables is now an
  explicit node in the tree, leader to cleaner code generation, as it now
  uses normal variable assignment code generation.

- The ``MaybeLocalVariables`` became explicit about which variable they
  might be, and contribute to its SSA trace as well, which was incomplete
  before.

- Removed some cases of code duplication that were marked as TODO items. This
  often resulted in cleanups.

- Do not use ``replaceWith`` on child nodes, that potentially were re-used
  during their computation.

Summary
-------

The release is mainly the result of consolidation work. While the previous
release contained many important enhancements, this is another important step
towards full SSA, closing one loop whole (class variables and ``exec``
functions), as well as applying it to local variables, largely extending its
use.

The amount of cleanups is tremendous, in huge part due to infrastructure
problems that prevented release repeatedly. This reduces the technological
debt very much.

More importantly, it would appear that now eliminating local and temporary
variables that are not necessary is only a small step away. But as usual, while
this may be easy to implement now, it will uncover more bugs in existing code,
that we need to address before we continue.


Nuitka Release 0.5.5
====================

This release is finally making full use of SSA analysis knowledge for code
generation, leading to many enhancements over previous releases.

It also adds support for Python3.4, which has been longer in the making, due
to many rather subtle issues. In fact, even more work will be needed to fully
solve remaining minor issues, but these should affect no real code.

And then there is much improved support for using standalone mode together
with virtualenv. This combination was not previously supported, but should
work now.

New Features
------------

- Added support for Python3.4

  This means support for ``clear`` method of frames to close generators,
  dynamic ``__qualname__``, affected by ``global`` statements, tuples as
  ``yield from`` arguments, improved error messages, additional checks, and
  many more detail changes.

New Optimization
----------------

- Using SSA knowledge, local variable assignments now no longer need to check
  if they need to release previous values, they know definitely for the most
  cases.

  .. code-block:: python

      def f():
          a = 1 # This used to check if old value of "a" needs a release
          ...

- Using SSA knowledge, local variable references now no longer need to check
  for raising exceptions, let alone produce exceptions for cases, where that
  cannot be.

  .. code-block:: python

      def f():
          a = 1
          return a # This used to check if "a" is assigned

- Using SSA knowledge, local variable references now are known if they can
  raise the ``UnboundLocalError`` exception or not. This allows to eliminate
  frame usages for many cases. Including the above example.

- Using less memory for keeping variable information.

- Also using less memory for constant nodes.

Bug Fixes
---------

- The standalone freezing code was reading Python source as UTF-8 and not using
  the code that handles the Python encoding properly. On some platforms there
  are files in standard library that are not encoded like that.

- The fiber implementation for Linux amd64 was not working with glibc from
  RHEL 5. Fixed to use  now multiple ``int`` to pass pointers as necessary.
  Also use ``uintptr_t`` instead of ``intprt_t`` to transport pointers, which
  may be more optimal.

- Line numbers for exceptions were corrupted by ``with`` statements due to
  setting line numbers even for statements marked as internal.

- Partial support for ``win32com`` by adding support for its hidden ``__path__``
  change.

- Python3: Finally figured out proper chaining of exceptions, given proper
  context messages for exception raised during the handling of exceptions.

- Corrected C++ memory leak for each closure variable taken, each time a
  function object was created.

- Python3: Raising exceptions with tracebacks already attached, wasn't using
  always them, but producing new ones instead.

- Some constants could cause errors, as they cannot be handled with the
  ``marshal`` module as expected, e.g. ``(int,)``.

- Standalone: Make sure to propagate ``sys.path`` to the Python instance used
  to check for standard library import dependencies. This is important for
  virtualenv environments, which need ``site.py`` to set the path, which is
  not executed in that mode.

- Windows: Added support for different path layout there, so using virtualenv
  should work there too.

- The code object flag "optimized" (fast locals as opposed to locals dictionary)
  for functions was set wrongly to value for the parent, but for frames inside
  it, one with the correct value. This lead to more code objects than necessary
  and false ``co_flags`` values attached to the function.

- Options passed to ``nuitka-python`` could get lost.

  .. code-block:: sh

     nuitka-python program.py argument1 argument2 ...

  The above is supposed to compile program.py, execute it immediately and
  pass the arguments to it. But when Nuitka decides to restart itself, it
  would forget these options. It does so to e.g. disable hash randomization
  as it would affect code generation.

- Raising tuples exception as exceptions was not compatible (Python2) or
  reference leaking (Python3).

Tests
-----

- Running ``2to3`` is now avoided for tests that are already running on both
  Python2 and Python3.

- Made XML based optimization tests work with Python3 too. Previously these
  were only working on Python2.

- Added support for ignoring messages that come from linking against
  self compiled Pythons.

- Added test case for threaded generators that tortures the fiber layer a bit
  and exposed issues on RHEL 5.

- Made reference count test of compiled functions generic. No more code
  duplication, and automatic detection of shared stuff. Also a more clear
  interface for disabling test cases.

- Added Python2 specific reference counting tests, so the other cases can
  be executed with Python3 directly, making debugging them less tedious.

Cleanups
--------

- Really important removal of "variable references". They didn't solve any
  problem anymore, but their complexity was not helpful either. This allowed
  to make SSA usable finally, and removed a lot of code.

- Removed special code generation for parameter variables, and their dedicated
  classes, no more needed, as every variable access code is now optimized like
  this.

- Stop using C++ class methods at all. Now only the destructor of local
  variables is actually supposed to do anything, and their are no methods
  anymore. The unused ``var_name`` got removed, ``setVariableValue`` is now
  done manually.

- Moved assertions for the fiber layer to a common place in the header, so they
  are executed on all platforms in debug mode.

- As usual, also a bunch of cleanups for PyLint were applied.

- The ``locals`` built-in code now uses code generation for accessing local
  variable values instead having its own stuff.

Organizational
--------------

- The Python version 3.4 is now officially supported. There are a few problems
  open, that will be addressed in future releases, none of which will affect
  normal people though.

- Major cleanup of Nuitka options.

   - Windows specific stuff is now in a dedicated option group. This includes
     options for icon, disabling console, etc.

   - There is now a dedicated group for controlling backend compiler choices
     and options.

- Also pickup ``g++44`` automatically, which makes using Nuitka on CentOS5
  more automatic.

Summary
-------

This release represents a very important step ahead. Using SSA for real stuff
will allow us to build the trust necessary to take the next steps. Using the
SSA information, we could start implementing more optimizations.


Nuitka Release 0.5.4
====================

This release is aiming at preparatory changes to enable optimization based
on SSA analysis, introducing a variable registry, so that variables no longer
trace their references to themselves.

Otherwise, MinGW64 support has been added, and lots of bug fixes were made to
improve the compatibility.

New Optimization
----------------

- Using new variable registry, now properly detecting actual need for sharing
  variables. Optimization may discover that it is unnecessary to share a
  variable, and then it no longer is. This also allows ``--debug`` without it
  reporting unused variable warnings on Python3.

- Scons startup has been accelerated, removing scans for unused tools, and
  avoiding making more than one gcc version check.

Bug Fixes
---------

- Compatibility: In case of unknown encodings, Nuitka was not giving the name
  of the problematic encoding in the error message. Fixed in 0.5.3.3 already.

- Submodules with the same name as built-in modules were wrongly shadowed.
  Fixed in 0.5.3.2 already.

- Python3: Added implementations of ``is_package`` to the meta path based
  loader.

- Python3.4: Added ``find_spec`` implementation to the meta path based loader
  for increased compatibility.

- Python3: Corrections for ``--debug`` to work with Python3 and MSVC compiler
  more often.

- Fixed crash with ``--show-scons`` when no compiler was found. Fixed in 0.5.3.5
  already.

- Standalone: Need to blacklist ``lib2to3`` from standard library as well. Fixed
  in 0.5.3.4 already.

- Python3: Adapted to changes in ``SyntaxError`` on newer Python releases, there
  is now a ``msg`` that can override ``reason``.

- Standalone Windows: Preserve ``sys.executable`` as it might be used to fork
  binaries.

- Windows: The caching of Scons was not arch specific, and files could be
  used again, even if changing the arch from ```x86`` to ``x86_64`` or
  back.

- Windows: On 32 bit Python it can happen that with large number of generators
  running concurrently (>1500), one cannot be started anymore. Raising an
  ``MemoryError`` now.

Organizational
--------------

- Added support for MinGW64. Currently needs to be run with ``PATH`` environment
  properly set up.

- Updated internal version of Scons to 2.3.2, which breaks support for VS 2008,
  but adds support for VS 2013 and VS 2012. The VS 2013 is now the recommended
  compiler.

- Added RPM package and repository for RHEL 7.

- The output of ``--show-scons`` now includes the used compiler, including the
  MSVC version.

- Added option ``--msvc`` to select the MSVC compiler version to use, which
  overrides automatic selection of the latest.

- Added option ``-python-flag=no_warnings`` to disable user and deprecation
  warnings at run time.

- Repository for Ubuntu Raring was removed, no more supported by Ubuntu.

Cleanups
--------

- Made technical and logical sharing decisions separate functions and implement
  them in a dedicated variable registry.

- The Scons file has seen a major cleanup.

Summary
-------

This release is mostly a maintenance release. The Scons integrations has been
heavily visited, as has been Python3 and esp. Python3.4 compatibility, and
results from the now possible debug test runs.

Standalone should be even more practical now, and MinGW64 is an option for those
cases, where MSVC is too slow.


Nuitka Release 0.5.3
====================

This release is mostly a follow up, resolving points that have become possible
to resolve after completing the C-ish evolution of Nuitka. So this is more of a
service release.

New Features
------------

- Improved mode ``--improved`` now sets error lines more properly than CPython
  does in many cases.

- The ``-python-flag=-S`` mode now preserves ``PYTHONPATH`` and therefore became
  usable with virtualenv.

New Optimization
----------------

- Line numbers of frames no longer get set unless an exception occurs, speeding
  up the normal path of execution.

- For standalone mode, using ``--python-flag-S`` is now always possible and
  yields less module usage, resulting in smaller binaries and faster
  compilation.

Bug Fixes
---------

- Corrected an issue for frames being optimized away where in fact they are
  still necessary. `Issue#140 <http://bugs.nuitka.net/issue140>`__. Fixed in
  0.5.2.1 already.

- Fixed handling of exception tests as side effects. These could be remainders
  of optimization, but didn't have code generation. Fixed in 0.5.2.1 already.

- Previously Nuitka only ever used the statement line as the line number for all
  the expression, even if it spawned multiple lines. Usually nothing important,
  and often even more correct, but sometimes not. Now the line number is most
  often the same as CPython in full compatibility mode, or better, see
  above. `Issue#9 <http://bugs.nuitka.net/issue9>`__.

- Python3.4: Standalone mode for Windows is working now.

- Standalone: Undo changes to ``PYTHONPATH`` or ``PYTHONHOME`` allowing
  potentially forked CPython programs to run properly.

- Standalone: Fixed import error when using PyQt and Python3.

New Tests
---------

- For our testing approach, the improved line number handling means we can undo
  lots of changes that are no more necessary.

- The compile library test has been extended to cover a third potential location
  where modules may live, covering the ``matplotlib`` module as a result.

Cleanups
--------

- In Python2, the list contractions used to be re-formulated to be function
  calls that have no frame stack entry of their own right. This required some
  special handling, in e.g. closure taking, and determining variable sharing
  across functions.

  This now got cleaned up to be properly in-lined in a ``try``/``finally``
  expression.

- The line number handling got simplified by pushing it into error exits only,
  removing the need to micro manage a line number stack which got removed.

- Use ``intptr_t`` over ``unsigned long`` to store fiber code pointers,
  increasing portability.

Organizational
--------------

- Providing own Debian/Ubuntu repositories for all relevant distributions.

- Windows MSI files for Python 3.4 were added.

- Hosting of the web site was moved to metal server with more RAM and
  performance.


Summary
-------

This release brings about structural simplification that is both a follow-up to
C-ish, as well as results from a failed attempt to remove static "variable
references" and be fully SSA based. It incorporates changes aimed at making this
next step in Nuitka evolution smaller.


Nuitka Release 0.5.2
====================

This is a major release, with huge changes to code generation that improve
performance in a significant way. It is a the result of a long development
period, and therefore contains a huge jump ahead.

New Features
------------

- Added experimental support for Python 3.4, which is still work in progress.

- Added support for virtualenv on MacOS.

- Added support for virtualenv on Windows.

- Added support for MacOS X standalone mode.

- The code generation uses no header files anymore, therefore adding a module
  doesn't invalidate all compiled object files from caches anymore.

- Constants code creation is now distributed, and constants referenced in a
  module are declared locally. This means that changing a module doesn't affect
  the validity of other modules object files from caches anymore.

New Optimization
----------------

- C-ish code generation uses less C++ classes and generates more C-like
  code. Explicit temporary objects are now used for statement temporary
  variables.

- The constants creation code is no more in a single file, but distributed
  across all modules, with only shared values created in a single file. This
  means improved scalability. There are remaining bad modules, but more often,
  standalone mode is now fast.

- Exception handling no longer uses C++ exception, therefore has become much
  faster.

- Loops that only break are eliminated.

- Dead code after loops that do not break is now removed.

- The ``try``/``finally`` and ``try``/``except`` constructs are now eliminated,
  where that is possible.

- The ``try``/``finally`` part of the re-formulation for ``print`` statements is
  now only done when printing to a file, avoiding useless node tree bloat.

- Tuples and lists are now generated with faster code.

- Locals and global variables are now access with more direct code.

- Added support for the anonymous ``code`` type built-in.

- Added support for ``compile`` built-in.

- Generators that statically return immediately, e.g. due to optimization
  results, are no longer using frame objects.

- The complex call helpers use no pseudo frames anymore. Previous code
  generation required to have them, but with C-ish code generation that is no
  more necessary, speeding up those kind of calls.

- Modules with only code that cannot raise, need not have a frame created for
  them. This avoids useless code size bloat because of them. Previously the
  frame stack entry was mandatory.

Bug Fixes
---------

- Windows: The resource files were cached by Scons and re-used, even if the
  input changed. The could lead to corrupted incremental builds. `Issue#129
  <http://bugs.nuitka.net/issue129>`__. Fixed in 0.5.1.1 already.

- Windows: For functions with too many local variables, the MSVC failed with an
  error "C1026: parser stack overflow, program too complex". The rewritten code
  generation doesn't burden the compiler as much. `Issue#127
  <http://bugs.nuitka.net/issue127>`__.

- Compatibility: The timing deletion of nested call arguments was different from
  C++. This shortcoming has been addressed in the rewritten code
  generation. `Issue#62 <http://bugs.nuitka.net/issue62>`__.

- Compatibility: The ``__future__`` flags and ``CO_FREECELL`` were not present
  in frame flags. These were then not always properly inherited to ``eval`` and
  ``exec`` in all cases.

- Compatibility: Compiled frames for Python3 had ``f_restricted`` attribute,
  which is Python2 only. Removed it.

- Compatibility: The ``SyntaxError`` of having a ``continue`` in a finally
  clause is now properly raised.

- Python2: The ``exec`` statement with no locals argument provided, was
  preventing list contractions to take closure variables.

- Python2: Having the ASCII encoding declared in a module wasn't working.

- Standalone: Included the ``idna`` encoding as well. `Issue#135
  <http://bugs.nuitka.net/issue135>`__.

- Standalone: For virtualenv, the file ``orig-prefix.txt`` needs to be present,
  now it's copied into the "dist" directory as well. `Issue#126
  <http://bugs.nuitka.net/issue126>`__. Fixed in 0.5.1.1 already.

- Windows: Handle cases, where Python and user program are installed on
  different volumes.

- Compatibility: Can now finally use ``execfile`` as an expression. `Issue#5
  <http://bugs.nuitka.net/issue5>`__ is finally fixed after all this time thanks
  to C-ish code generation.

- Compatibility: The order or call arguments deletion is now finally compatible.
  `Issue#62 <http://bugs.nuitka.net/issue62>`__ also is finally fixed. This too
  is thanks to C-ish code generation.

- Compatibility: Code object flags are now more compatible for Python3.

- Standalone: Removing "rpath" settings of shared libraries and extension
  modules included. This makes standalone binaries more robust on Fedora 20.

- Python2: Wasn't falsely rejecting ``unicode`` strings as values for ``int``
  and ``long`` variants with base argument provided.

- Windows: For Python3.2 and 64 bits, global variable accesses could give false
  ``NameError`` exceptions. Fixed in 0.5.1.6 already.

- Compatibility: Many ``exec`` and ``eval`` details have become more correctly,
  the argument handling is more compatible, and e.g. future flags are now passed
  along properly.

- Compatibility: Using ``open`` with no arguments is now giving the same error.

Organizational
--------------

- Replying to email from the `issue tracker <http://bugs.nuitka.net>`__ works
  now.

- Added option name alias ``--xml`` for ``--dump-xml``.

- Added option name alias ``--python-dbg`` for ``--python-debug``, which
  actually might make it a bit more clear that it is about using the CPython
  debug run time.

- Remove option ``--dump-tree``, it had been broken for a long time and unused
  in favor of XML dumps.

- New digital art folder with 3D version of Nuitka logo. Thanks to Juan Carlos
  for creating it.

- Using "README.rst" instead of "README.txt" to make it look better on web
  pages.

- More complete whitelisting of missing imports in standard library. These
  should give no warnings anymore.

- Updated the Nuitka GUI to the latest version, with enhanced features.

- The builds of releases and update of the `downloads page
  <http://nuitka.net/pages/download.html>`__ is now driven by Buildbot. Page
  will be automatically updated as updated binaries arrive.

Cleanups
--------

- Temporary keeper variables and the nodes to handle them are now unified with
  normal temporary variables, greatly simplifying variable handling on that
  level.

- Less code is coming from templates, more is actually derived from the node
  tree instead.

- Releasing the references to temporary variables is now always explicit in the
  node tree.

- The publishing and preservation of exceptions in frames was turned into
  explicit nodes.

- Exception handling is now done with a single handle that checks with branches
  on the exception. This eliminates exception handler nodes.

- The ``dir`` built-in with no arguments is now re-formulated to ``locals`` or
  ``globals`` with their ``.keys()`` attribute taken.

- Dramatic amounts of cleanups to code generation specialties, that got done
  right for the new C-ish code generation.

New Tests
---------

- Warnings from MSVC are now error exits for ``--debug`` mode too, expanding the
  coverage of these tests.

- The outputs with ``python-dbg`` can now also be compared, allowing to expand
  test coverage for reference counts.

- Many of the basic tests are now executable with Python3 directly. This allows
  for easier debug.

- The library compilation test is now also executed with Python3.

Summary
-------

This release would deserve more than a minor number increase. The C-ish code
generation, is a huge body of work. In many ways, it lays ground to taking
benefit of SSA results, that previously would not have been possible. In other
ways, it's incomplete in not yet taking full advantage yet.

The release contains so many improvements, that are not yet fully realized, but
as a compiler, it also reflects a stable and improved state.

The important changes are about making SSA even more viable. Many of the
problematic cases, e.g. exception handlers, have been stream lined. A whole
class of variables, temporary keepers, has been eliminated. This is big news in
this domain.

For the standalone users, there are lots of refinements. There is esp. a lot of
work to create code that doesn't show scalability issues. While some remain, the
most important problems have been dealt with. Others are still in the pipeline.

More work will be needed to take full advantage. This has been explained in a
`separate post <http://nuitka.net/posts/state-of-nuitka.html>`__ in greater
detail.


Nuitka Release 0.5.1
====================

This release brings corrections and major improvements to how standalone mode
performs. Much of it was contributed via patches and bug reports.

Bug Fixes
---------

- There was a crash when using ``next`` on a non-iterable. Fixed in 0.5.0.1
  already.

- Module names with special characters not allowed in C identifiers were not
  fully supported. `Issue#118 <http://bugs.nuitka.net/issue118>`__. Fixed in
  0.5.0.1 already.

- Name mangling for classes with leading underscores was not removing them from
  resulting attribute names. This broke at ``__slots__`` with private attributes
  for such classes. `Issue#119 <http://bugs.nuitka.net/issue119>`__. Fixed in
  0.5.0.1 already.

- Standalone on Windows might need "cp430" encoding. `Issue#120
  <http://bugs.nuitka.net/issue120>`__. Fixed in 0.5.0.2 already.

- Standalone mode didn't work with ``lxml.etree`` due to lack of hard coded
  dependencies. When a shared library imports things, Nuitka cannot detect it
  easily.

- Wasn't working on MacOS 64 bits due to using Linux 64 bits specific
  code. `Issue#123 <http://bugs.nuitka.net/issue123>`__. Fixed in 0.5.0.2
  already.

- On MinGW the constants blob was not properly linked on some installations,
  this is now done differently (see below).

New Features
------------

- Memory usages are now traced with ``--show-progress`` allowing us to trace
  where things go wrong.

New Optimization
----------------

- Standalone mode now includes standard library as bytecode by default. This is
  workaround scalability issues with many constants from many modules. Future
  releases are going to undo it.

- On Windows the constants blob is now stored as a resource, avoiding
  compilation via C code for MSVC as well. MinGW was changed to use the same
  code.

New Tests
---------

- Expanded test coverage for "standalone mode" demonstrating usage of "hex"
  encoding, PySide, and PyGtk packages.

Summary
-------

This release is mostly an interim maintenance release for standalone. Major
changes that provide optimization beyond that, termed "C-ish code generation"
are delayed for future releases.

This release makes standalone practical which is an important point. Instead of
hour long compilation, even for small programs, we are down to less than a
minute.

The solution of the scalability issues with many constants from many modules
will be top priority going forward. Since they are about how even single use
constants are created all in one place, this will be easy, but as large changes
are happening in "C-ish code generation", we are waiting for these to complete.


Nuitka Release 0.5.0
====================

This release breaks interface compatibility, therefore the major version number
change. Also "standalone mode" has seen significant improvements on both
Windows, and Linux. Should work much better now.

But consider that this part of Nuitka is still in its infancy. As it is not the
top priority of mine for Nuitka, which primarily is intended as an super
compatible accelerator of Python, it will continue to evolve nearby.

There is also many new optimization based on structural improvements in the
direction of actual SSA.

Bug Fixes
---------

- The "standalone mode" was not working on all Redhat, Fedora, and openSUSE
  platforms and gave warnings with older compilers. Fixed in 0.4.7.1 already.

- The "standalone mode" was not including all useful encodings. `Issue#116
  <http://bugs.nuitka.net/issue116>`__. Fixed in 0.4.7.2 already.

- The "standalone mode" was defaulting to ``--python-flag=-S`` which disables
  the parsing of "site" module. That unfortunately made it necessary to reach
  some modules without modifying ``PYTHONPATH`` which conflicts with the
  "out-of-the-box" experience.

- The "standalone mode" is now handling packages properly and generally working
  on Windows as well.

- The syntax error of having an all catching except clause and then a more
  specific one wasn't causing a ``SyntaxError`` with Nuitka.

  .. code-block:: python

     try:
         something()
     except:
         somehandling():
     except TypeError:
         notallowed()

- A corruption bug was identified, when re-raising exceptions, the top entry of
  the traceback was modified after usage. Depending on ``malloc`` this was
  potentially causing an endless loop when using it for output.

New Features
------------

- Windows: The "standalone" mode now properly detects used DLLs using
  `Dependency Walker <http://http://www.dependencywalker.com/>`__ which it
  offers to download and extra for you.

  It is used as a replacement to ``ldd`` on Linux when building the binary, and
  as a replacement of ``strace`` on Linux when running the tests to check that
  nothing is loaded from the outside.

New Optimization
----------------

- When iterating over ``list``, ``set``, this is now automatically lowered to
  ``tuples`` avoiding the mutable container types.

  So the following code is now equivalent:

  .. code-block:: python

     for x in [ a, b, c ]:
        ...

     # same as
     for x in (a, b, c):
        ...

  For constants, this is even more effective, because for mutable constants, no
  more is it necessary to make a copy.

- Python2: The iteration of large ``range`` is now automatically lowered to
  ``xrange`` which is faster to loop over, and more memory efficient.

- Added support for the ``xrange`` built-in.

- The statement only expression optimization got generalized and now is capable
  of removing useless parts of operations, not only the whole thing when it has
  not side effects.

  .. code-block:: python

     [a,b]

     # same as
     a
     b

  This works for all container types.

  Another example is ``type`` built-in operation with single argument. When the
  result is not used, it need not be called.

  .. code-block:: python

     type(a)

     # same as
     a

  And another example ``is`` and ``is not`` have no effect of their own as well,
  therefore:

  .. code-block:: python

     a is b

     # same as
     a
     b

- Added proper handling of conditional expression branches in SSA based
  optimization. So far these branches were ignored, which only acceptable for
  temporary variables as created by tree building, but not other variable
  types. This is preparatory for introducing SSA for local variables.


Organizational
--------------

- The option ``--exe`` is now ignored and creating an executable is the default
  behavior of ``nuitka``, a new option ``--module`` allows to produce extension
  modules.

- The binary ``nuitka-python`` was removed, and is replaced by ``nuitka-run``
  with now only implies ``--execute`` on top of what ``nuitka`` is.

- Using dedicated `Buildbot <http://buildbot.net>`__ for continuous integration
  testing and release creation as well.

- The `Downloads <http://nuitka.net/pages/download.html>`__ now offers MSI files
  for Win64 as well.

- Discontinued the support for cross compilation to Win32. That was too limited
  and the design choice is to have a running CPython instance of matching
  architecture at Nuitka compile time.

New Tests
---------

- Expanded test coverage for "standalone mode" demonstrating usage of "hex"
  encoding, and PySide package.

Summary
-------

The "executable by default" interface change improves on the already high ease
of use. The new optimization do not give all that much in terms of numbers, but
are all signs of structural improvements, and it is steadily approaching the
point, where the really interesting stuff will happen.

The progress for standalone mode is of course significant. It is still not quite
there yet, but it is making quick progress now. This will attract a lot of
attention hopefully.

As for optimization, the focus for it has shifted to making exception handlers
work optimal by default (publish the exception to sys.exc_info() and create
traceback only when necessary) and be based on standard branches. Removing
special handling of exception handlers, will be the next big step. This release
includes some correctness fixes stemming from that work already.


Nuitka Release 0.4.7
====================

This release includes important new features, lots of polishing cleanups, and
some important performance improvements as well.

Bug Fixes
---------

- The RPM packages didn't build due to missing in-line copy of Scons. Fixed in
  0.4.6.1 already.

- The recursion into modules and unfreezing them was not working for packages
  and modules anymore. Fixed in 0.4.6.2 already.

- The Windows installer was not including Scons. Fixed in 0.4.6.3 already.

- Windows: The immediate execution as performed by ``nuitka --execute`` was not
  preserving the exit code. `Issue#26 <http://bugs.nuitka.net/issue26>`__.

- Python3.3: Packages without ``__init.py__`` were not properly embedding the
  name-space package as well.

- Python3: Fix, modules and packages didn't add themselves to ``sys.modules``
  which they should, happened only for programs.

- Python3.3: Packages should set ``__package`` to their own name, not the one of
  their parents.

- Python3.3: The ``__qualname__`` of nested classes was corrected.

- For modules that recursed to other modules, an infinite loop could be
  triggered when comparing types with rich comparisons. `Issue#115
  <http://bugs.nuitka.net/issue115>`__.

New Features
------------

- The "standalone" mode allows to compile standalone binaries for programs and
  run them without Python installation. The DLLs loaded by extension modules on
  Windows need to be added manually, on Linux these are determined
  automatically already.

  To achieve running without Python installation, Nuitka learned to freeze
  bytecode as an alternative to compiling modules, as some modules need to be
  present when the CPython library is initialized.

- New option ``--python-flag`` allows to specify flags to the compiler that the
  "python" binary normally would. So far ``-S`` and ``-v`` are supported, with
  sane aliases ``no_site`` and ``trace_imports``.

  The recommended use of ``--python-flag=-S`` is to avoid dependency creep in
  standalone mode compilations, because the ``site`` module often imports many
  useless things that often don't apply to target systems.

New Optimization
----------------

- Faster frame stack handling for functions without ``try``/``except`` (or
  ``try``/``finally`` in Python3). This gives a speed boost to "PyStone" of
  ca. 2.5% overall.

- Python2: Faster attribute getting and setting, handling special cases at
  compile time. This gives a minor speed boost to "PyStone" of ca. 0.5% overall.

- Python2: Much quicker calls of ``__getattr__`` and ``__setattr__`` as this is
  now using the quicker call method avoiding temporary tuples.

- Don't treat variables usages used in functions called directly by their owner
  as shared. This leads to more efficient code generation for contractions and
  class bodies.

- Create ``unicode`` constants directly from their UTF-8 string representation
  for Python2 as well instead of un-streaming. So far this was only done for
  Python3. Affects only program start-up.

- Directly create ``int`` and ``long`` constants outside of ``2**31`` and
  ``2**32-1``, but only limited according to actual platform values. Affects
  only program start-up.

- When creating ``set`` values, no longer use a temporary ``tuple`` value, but
  use a properly generated helper functions instead. This makes creating sets
  much faster.

- Directly create ``set`` constants instead of un-streaming them. Affects only
  program start-up.

- For correct line numbers in traceback, the current frame line number must be
  updated during execution. This was done more often than necessary, e.g. loops
  set the line number before loop entry, and at first statement.

- Module variables are now accessed even faster, the gain for "PyStone" is only
  0.1% and mostly the result of leaner code.

Organizational
--------------

- The "standalone mode" code (formerly known as "portable mode" has been redone
  and activated. This is a feature that a lot of people expect from a compiler
  naturally. And although the overall goal for Nuitka is of course acceleration,
  this kind of packaging is one of the areas where CPython needs improvement.

- Added package for Ubuntu 13.10 for download, removed packages for Ubuntu 11.04
  and 11.10, no more supported.

- Added package for openSUSE 13.1 for download.

- Nuitka is now part of Arch and can be installed with ``pacman -S nuitka``.

- Using dedicated `Buildbot <http://buildbot.net>`__ for continuous integration
  testing. Not yet public.

- Windows: In order to speed up repeated compilation on a platform without
  ``ccache``, added Scons level caching in the build directory.

- Disabled hash randomization for inside Nuitka (but not in ultimately created
  binaries) for a more stable output, because dictionary constants will not
  change around. This makes the build results possible to cache for ``ccache``
  and Scons as well.

Tests
-----

- The ``programs`` tests cases now fail if module or directory recursion is not
  working, being executed in another directory.

- Added test runner for packages, with initial test case for package with
  recursion and sub-packages.

- Made some test cases more strict by reducing ``PYTHONPATH`` provision.

- Detect use of extra flags in tests that don't get consumed avoiding
  ineffective flags.

- Use ``--execute`` on Windows as well, the issue that prevented it has been
  solved after all.

Cleanups
--------

- The generated code uses ``const_``, ``var_``, ``par_`` prefixes in the
  generated code and centralized the decision about these into single place.

- Module variables no longer use C++ classes for their access, but instead
  accessor functions, leading to much less code generated per module variable
  and removing the need to trace their usage during code generation.

- The test runners now share common code in a dedicated module, previously they
  replicated it all, but that turned out to be too tedious.

- Massive general cleanups, many of which came from new contributor Juan Carlos
  Paco.

- Moved standalone and freezer related codes to dedicated package
  ``nuitka.freezer`` to not pollute the ``nuitka`` package name space.

- The code generation use variable identifiers and their accesses was cleaned
  up.

- Removed several not-so-special case identifier classes because they now behave
  more identical and all work the same way, so a parameters can be used to
  distinguish them.

- Moved main program, function object, set related code generation to dedicated
  modules.

Summary
-------

This release marks major technological progress with the introduction of the
much sought standalone mode and performance improvements from improved code
generation.

The major break through for SSA optimization was not yet achieved, but this is
again making progress in the direction of it. Harmonizing variables of different
kinds was an important step ahead.

Also very nice is the packaging progress, Nuitka was accepted into Arch after
being in Debian Testing for a while already. Hope is to see more of this kind of
integration in the future.


Nuitka Release 0.4.6
====================

This release includes progress on all fronts. The primary focus was to advance
SSA optimization over older optimization code that was already in place. In this
domain, there are mostly cleanups.

Another focus has been to enhance Scons with MSVC on Windows. Nuitka now finds
an installed MSVC compiler automatically, properly handles architecture of
Python and Windows. This improves usability a lot.

Then this is also very much about bug fixes. There have been several hot fixes
for the last release, but a complicated and major issue forced a new release,
and many other small issues.

And then there is performance. As can be seen in the `performance graph
<http://nuitka.net/pages/performance.html>`__, this release is the fastest so
far. This came mainly from examining the need for comparison slots for compiled
types.

And last, but not least, this also expands the base of supported platforms,
adding Gentoo, and self compiled Python to the mix.

Bug Fixes
---------

- Support Nuitka being installed to a path that contains spaces and handle main
  programs with spaces in their paths. `Issue#106
  <http://bugs.nuitka.net/issue106>`__. Fixed in 0.4.5.1 already.

- Support Python being installed to a path that contains spaces. `Issue#106
  <http://bugs.nuitka.net/issue106>`__. Fixed in 0.4.5.2 already.

- Windows: User provided constants larger than 65k didn't work with
  MSVC. `Issue#108 <http://bugs.nuitka.net/issue108>`__. Fixed in 0.4.5.3
  already.

- Windows: The option ``--windows-disable-console`` was not effective with
  MSVC. `Issue#107 <http://bugs.nuitka.net/issue107>`__. Fixed in 0.4.5.3
  already.

- Windows: For some users, Scons was detecting their MSVC installation properly
  already from registry, but it didn't honor the target architecture. `Issue#99
  <http://bugs.nuitka.net/issue99>`__. Fixed in 0.4.5.3 already.

- When creating Python modules, these were marked as executable ("x" bit), which
  they are of course not. Fixed in 0.4.5.3 already.

- Python3.3: On architectures where ``Py_ssize_t`` is not the same as ``long``
  this could lead to errors. Fixed in 0.4.5.3 already.

- Code that was using nested mutable constants and changed the nested ones was
  not executing correctly. `Issue#112 <http://bugs.nuitka.net/issue112>`__.

- Python2: Due to list contractions being re-formulated as functions, ``del``
  was rejected for the variables assigned in the contraction. `Issue#111
  <http://bugs.nuitka.net/issue111>`__.

  .. code-block:: python

     [ expr(x) for x in iterable() ]

     del x # Should work, was gave an unjustified SyntaxError.

New Features
------------

- Compiled types when used in Python comparison now work. Code like this will
  work:

  .. code-block:: python

     def f():
        pass

     assert type(f) == types.FunctionType

  This of course also works for ``in`` operator, and is another step ahead in
  compatibility, and surprising too. And best of all, this works even if the
  checking code is not compiled with Nuitka.

- Windows: Detecting MSVC installation from registry, if no compiler is already
  present in PATH.

- Windows: Now options ``--mingw`` to force compilation with MinGW.

New Optimization
----------------

- Rich comparisons (``==``, ``<``, and the like) are now faster than ever before
  due to a full implementation of its own in Nuitka that eliminates a bit of the
  overhead. In the future, we will aim at giving it type hints to make it even
  faster. This gives a minor speed boost to PyStone of ca. 0.7% overall.

- Integer comparisons are now treated preferably, as they are in CPython, which
  gives 1.3% speed boost to CPython.

- The SSA based analysis is now used to provide variable scopes for temporary
  variables as well as reference count needs.

Cleanups
--------

- Replaced "value friend" based optimization code with SSA based optimization,
  which allowed to remove complicated and old code that was still used mainly in
  optimization of ``or`` and ``and`` expressions.

- Delayed declaration of temp variables and their reference type is now
  performed based on information from SSA, which may given more accurate
  results. Not using "variable usage" profiles for this anymore.

- The Scons interface and related code got a massive overhaul, making it more
  consistent and better documented. Also updated the internal copy to 2.3.0 for
  the platforms that use it, mostly Windows.

- Stop using ``os.system`` and ``subprocess.call(..., shell = True)`` as it is
  not really portable at all, use ``subprocess.call(..., shell = False)``
  instead.

- As usual lots of cleanups related to line length issues and PyLint.

Organizational
--------------

- Added support for Gentoo Linux.

- Added support for self compiled Python versions with and without debug
  enabled. `Issue#110 <http://bugs.nuitka.net/issue110>`__

- Added use of Nuitka fonts for headers in manuals.

- Does not install in-line copy of Scons only on systems where it is not going
  to be used, that is mostly non-Windows, and Linux where it is not already
  present. This makes for cleaner RPM packages.

Summary
-------

While the SSA stuff is not yet bearing performance fruits, it starts to carry
weight. Taking over the temporary variable handling now also means we can apply
the same stuff to local variables later.

To make up for the delay in SSA driven performance improvements, there is more
traditional code acceleration for rich comparisons, making it significant, and
the bug fixes make Nuitka more compatible than ever.

So give this a roll, it's worth it. And feel free to `join the mailing list
<http://nuitka.net/pages/mailinglist.html>`_ or `make a donation
<http://nuitka.net/pages/donations.html>`__ to support Nuitka.


Nuitka Release 0.4.5
====================

This release incorporates very many bug fixes, most of which were already part
of hot fixes, usability improvements, documentation improvements, new logo,
simpler Python3 on Windows, warnings for recursion options, and so on. So it's
mostly a consolidation release.

Bug Fixes
---------

- When targeting Python 3.x, Nuitka was using "python" to run Scons to run it
  under Python 2.x, which is not good enough on systems, where that is already
  Python3. Improved to only do the guessing where necessary (i.e. when using the
  in-line copy of Scons) and then to prefer "python2". `Issue#95
  <http://bugs.nuitka.net/issue95>`__. Fixed in 0.4.4.1 already.

- When using Nuitka created binaries inside a "virtualenv", created programs
  would instantly crash. The attempt to load and patch ``inspect`` module was
  not making sure that ``site`` module was already imported, but inside the
  "virtualenv", it cannot be found unless. `Issue#96
  <http://bugs.nuitka.net/issue96>`__. Fixed in 0.4.4.1 already.

- The option ``--recurse-directory`` to include plugin directories was
  broken. `Issue#97 <http://bugs.nuitka.net/issue97>`__. Fixed in 0.4.4.2
  already.

- Python3: Files with "BOM" marker causes the compiler to crash. `Issue#98
  <http://bugs.nuitka.net/issue98>`__. Fixed in 0.4.4.2 already.

- Windows: The generated code for ``try``/``return``/``finally`` was working
  with gcc (and therefore MinGW), but not with MSVC, causing crashes. `Issue#102
  <http://bugs.nuitka.net/issue102>`__. Fixed in 0.4.4.2 already.

- The option ``--recurse-all`` did not recurse to package ``__init__.py`` files
  in case ``from x.y import z`` syntax was used. `Issue#100
  <http://bugs.nuitka.net/issue100>`__. Fixed in 0.4.4.2 already.

- Python3 on MacOS: Corrected link time error. Fixed in 0.4.4.2 already.

- Python3.3 on Windows: Fixed crash with too many arguments to a kwonly argument
  using function. Fixed in 0.4.4.2 already.

- Python3.3 on Windows: Using "yield from" resulted in a link time error. Fixed
  in 0.4.4.2 already.

- Windows: Added back XML manifest, found a case where it is needed to prevent
  clashes with binary modules.

- Windows: Generators only worked in the main Python threads. Some unusual
  threading modules therefore failed.

- Using ``sys.prefix`` to find the Python installation instead of hard coded
  paths. `Issue#103 <http://bugs.nuitka.net/issue103>`__.

New Features
------------

- Windows: Python3 finds Python2 installation to run Scons automatically now.

  Nuitka itself runs under Python3 just fine, but in order to build the
  generated C++ code into binaries, it uses Scons which still needs Python2.

  Nuitka will now find the Python2 installation searching Windows registry
  instead of requiring hard coded paths.

- Windows: Python2 and Python3 find their headers now even if Python is not
  installed to specific paths.

  The installation path now is passed on to Scons which then uses it.

- Better error checking for ``--recurse-to`` and ``--recurse-not-to`` arguments,
  tell the user not to use directory paths.

- Added a warning for ``--recurse-to`` arguments that end up having no effect to
  the final result.

Cleanups
--------

- Import mechanism got cleaned up, stopped using "PyImport_ExtendInittab". It
  does not handle packages, and the ``sys.meta_path`` based importer is now well
  proven.

- Moved some of the constraint collection code mess into proper places. It still
  remains a mess.

Organizational
--------------

- Added ``LICENSE.txt`` file with Apache License 2.0 text to make it more
  immediately obvious which license Nuitka is under.

- Added section about Nuitka license to the "`User Manual
  <http://nuitka.net/doc/user-manual.html#license>`__".

- Added `Nuitka Logo <http://nuitka.net/doc/images/Nuitka-Logo-Symbol.png>`__
  to the distribution.

- Use Nuitka Logo as the bitmap in the Windows installer.

- Use Nuitka Logo in the documentation ("`User Manual
  <http://nuitka.net/doc/user-manual.html>`__" and "`Developer Manual
  <http://nuitka.net/doc/developer-manual.html>`__").

- Enhanced documentation to number page numbers starting after table of
  contents, removed header/footer from cover pages.

Summary
-------

This release is mostly the result of improvements made based on the surge of
users after Europython 2013. Some people went to extents and reported their
experience very detailed, and so I could aim at making e.g. their misconceptions
about how recursion options work, more obvious through warnings and errors.

This release is not addressing performance improvements. The next release will
be able to focus on that. I am taking my claim of full compatibility very
serious, so any time it's broken, it's the highest priority to restore it.


Nuitka Release 0.4.4
====================

This release marks the point, where Nuitka for the first time supports all major
current Python versions and all major features. It adds Python 3.3 support and
it adds support for threading. And then there is a massive amount of fixes that
improve compatibility even further.

Aside of that, there is major performance work. One side is the optimization of
call performance (to CPython non-compiled functions) and to compiled functions,
both. This gave a serious improvement to performance.

Then of course, we are making other, long term performance progress, as in
"--experimental" mode, the SSA code starts to optimize unused code away. That
code is not yet ready for prime time yet, but the trace structure will hold.

New Features
------------

- Python3.3 support.

  The test suite of CPython3.3 passes now too. The ``yield from`` is now
  supported, but the improved argument parsing error messages are not
  implemented yet.

- Tracing user provided constants, now Nuitka warns about too large constants
  produced during optimization.

- Line numbers of expressions are now updates as evaluation progresses. This
  almost corrects.

  Finally improves `Issue#9 <http://bugs.nuitka.net/issue9>`__. Now only
  expression parts that cannot raise, do not update, which can still cause
  difference, but much less often, and then definitely useless.

- Experimental support for threads.

  Threading appears to work just fine in the most cases. It's not as optimal as
  I wanted it to be, but that's going to change with time.

New Optimization
----------------

- Previous corrections for ``==``, ``!=``, and ``<=``, caused a performance
  regression for these operations in case of handling identical objects.

  For built-in objects of sane types (not ``float``), these operations are now
  accelerated again. The overreaching acceleration of ``>=`` was still there
  (bug, see below) and has been adapted too.

- Calling non-compiled Python functions from compiled functions was slower than
  in CPython. It is now just as fast.

- Calling compiled functions without keyword arguments has been accelerated with
  a dedicated entry point that may call the implementation directly and avoid
  parameter parsing almost entirely.

- Making calls to compiled and non-compiled Python functions no longer requires
  to build a temporary tuple and therefore is much faster.

- Parameter parsing code is now more compact, and re-uses error raises, or
  creates them on the fly, instead of hard coding it. Saves binary size and
  should be more cache friendly.

Bug Fixes
---------

- Corrected false optimization of ``a >= a`` on C++ level.

  When it's not done during Nuitka compile time optimization, the rich
  comparison helper still contained short cuts for ``>=``. This is now the same
  for all the comparison operators.

- Calling a function with default values, not providing it, and not providing a
  value for a value without default, was not properly detecting the error, and
  instead causing a run time crash.

  .. code-block:: python

     def f(a, b = 2):
         pass

     f(b = 2)

  This now properly raises the ``TypeError`` exception.

- Constants created with ``+`` could become larger than the normally enforced
  limits. Not as likely to become huge, but still potentially an issue.

- The ``vars`` built-in, when used on something without ``__dict__`` attribute,
  was giving ``AttributeError`` instead of ``TypeError``.

- When re-cursing to modules at compile time, script directory and current
  directory were used last, while at run time, it was the other way around,
  which caused overloaded standard library modules to not be embedded. Corrects
  `Issue#94 <http://bugs.nuitka.net/issue94>`__.

  Thanks for the patch to James Michael DuPont.

- Super without arguments was not raising the correct ``RuntimeError`` exception
  in functions that cannot be methods, but ``UnboundLocalError`` instead.

  .. code-block:: python

     def f():
        super() # Error, cannot refer to first argument of f

- Generators no longer use ``raise StopIteration`` for return statements,
  because that one is not properly handled in ``try``/``except`` clauses, where
  it's not supposed to trigger, while ``try``/``finally`` should be honored.

- Exception error message when throwing non-exceptions into generators was not
  compatible.

- The use of ``return`` with value in generators is a ``SyntaxError`` before
  Python3.3, but that was not raised.

- Variable names of the "__var" style need to be mangled. This was only done for
  classes, but not for functions contained in classes, there they are now
  mangled too.

- Python3: Exceptions raised with causes were not properly chaining.

- Python3: Specifying the file encoding corrupted line numbers, making them all
  of by one.

Cleanups
--------

- For containers (``tuple``, ``list``, ``set``, ``dict``) defined on the source
  code level, Nuitka immediately created constant references from them.

  For function calls, class creations, slice objects, this code is now re-used,
  and its dictionaries and tuples, may now become constants immediately,
  reducing noise in optimization steps.

- The parameter parsing code got cleaned up. There were a lot of relics from
  previously explored paths. And error raises were part of the templates, but
  now are external code.

- Global variable management moved to module objects and out of "Variables"
  module.

- Make sure, nodes in the tree are not shared by accident.

  This helped to find a case of duplicate use in the complex call helpers
  functions. Code generation will now notice this kind of duplication in debug
  mode.

- The complex call helper functions were manually taking variable closure, which
  made these functions inconsistent to other functions, e.g. no variable version
  was allocated to assignments.

  Removing the manual setting of variables allowed a huge reduction of code
  volume, as it became more generic code.

- Converting user provided constants to create containers into constants
  immediately, to avoid noise from doing this in optimization.

- The ``site`` module is now imported explicitly in the ``__main__`` module, so
  it can be handled by the recursion code as well. This will help portable mode.

- Many line length 80 changes, improved comments.

New Tests
---------

- The CPython3.3 test suite was added, and run with both Python3.2 and
  Python3.3, finding new bugs.

- The ``doctest`` to code generation didn't successfully handle all tests, most
  notably, "test_generators.py" was giving a ``SyntaxError`` and therefore not
  actually active. Correcting that improved the coverage of generator testing.

Organizational
--------------

- The portable code is still delayed.

  Support for Python3.3 was a higher priority, but the intention is to get it
  into shape for Europython still.

  Added notes about it being disabled it in the "`User Manual
  <http://nuitka.net/doc/user-manual.html>`__" documentation.

Summary
-------

This release is in preparation for Europython 2013. Wanted to get this much out,
as it changes the status slides quite a bit, and all of that was mostly done in
my Cyprus holiday a while ago.

The portable code has not seen progress. The idea here is to get this into a
development version later.


Nuitka Release 0.4.3
====================

This release expands the reach of Nuitka substantially, as new platforms and
compilers are now supported. A lot of polish has been applied. Under the hood
there is the continued and in-progress effort to implement SSA form in Nuitka.

New Features
------------

- Support for new compiler: Microsoft Visual C++.

  You can now use Visual Studio 2008 or Visual Studio 2010 for compiling under
  Windows.

- Support for NetBSD.

  Nuitka works for at least NetBSD 6.0, older versions may or may not work. This
  required fixing bugs in the generic "fibers" implementation.

- Support for Python3 under Windows too.

  Nuitka uses Scons to build the generated C++ files. Unfortunately it requires
  Python2 to execute, which is not readily available to call from Python3. It
  now guesses the default installation paths of CPython 2.7 or CPython 2.6 and
  it will use it for running Scons instead. You have to install it to
  ``C:\Python26`` or ``C:\Python27`` for Nuitka to be able to find it.

- Enhanced Python 3.3 compatibility.

  The support the newest version of Python has been extended, improving
  compatibility for many minor corner cases.

- Added warning when a user compiles a module and executes it immediately when
  that references ``__name__``.

  Because very likely the intention was to create an executable. And esp. if
  there is code like this:

  .. code-block:: python

     if __name__ == "__main__":
        main()

  In module mode, Nuitka will optimize it away, and nothing will happen on
  execution. This is because the command

  .. code-block:: sh

     nuitka --execute module

  is behavioral more like

     python -c "import module"

  and that was a trap for new users.

- All Linux architectures are now supported. Due to changes in how evaluation
  order is enforced, we don't have to implement for specific architectures
  anymore.

Bug Fixes
---------

- Dictionary creation was not fully compatible.

  As revealed by using Nuitka with CPython3.3, the order in which dictionaries
  are to be populated needs to be reversed, i.e. CPython adds the last item
  first. We didn't observe this before, and it's likely the new dictionary
  implementation that finds it.

  Given that hash randomization makes dictionaries item order undetermined
  anyway, this is more an issue of testing.

- Evaluation order for arguments of calls was not effectively enforced. It is
  now done in a standards compliant and therefore fully portable way. The
  compilers and platforms so far supported were not affected, but the newly
  supported Visual Studio C++ compiler was.

- Using a ``__future__`` import inside a function was giving an assertion,
  instead of the proper syntax error.

- Python3: Do not set the attributes ``sys.exc_type``, ``sys.exc_value``,
  ``sys.exc_traceback``.

- Python3: Annotations of function worked only as long as their definition was
  not referring to local variables.

New Optimization
----------------

- Calls with no positional arguments are now using the faster call methods.

  The generated C++ code was using the ``()`` constant at call site, when doing
  calls that use no positional arguments, which is of course useless.

- For Windows now uses OS "Fibers" for Nuitka "Fibers".

  Using threads for fibers was causing only overhead and with this API, MSVC had
  less issues too.

Organizational
--------------

- Accepting `Donations <http://nuitka.net/pages/donations.html>`__ via Paypal,
  please support funding travels, website, etc.

- The "`User Manual <http://nuitka.net/doc/user-manual.html>`__" has been
  updated with new content. We now do support Visual Studio, documented the
  required LLVM version for clang, Win64 and modules may include modules too,
  etc. Lots of information was no longer accurate and has been updated.

- The Changelog has been improved for consistency, wordings, and styles.

- Nuitka is now available on the social code platforms as well

  * `Bitbucket <https://bitbucket.org/kayhayen/nuitka>`__
  * `Github <https://github.com/kayhayen/Nuitka>`__
  * `Gitorious <https://gitorious.org/nuitka/nuitka>`__
  * `Google Code <https://code.google.com/p/nuitka/>`__

- Removed "clean-up.sh", which is practically useless, as tests now clean up
  after themselves reasonably, and with ``git clean -dfx`` working better.

- Removed "create-environment.sh" script, which was only setting the ``PATH``
  variable, which is not necessary.

- Added ``check-with-pylint --emacs`` option to make output its work with Emacs
  compilation mode, to allow easier fixing of warnings from PyLint.

- Documentation is formatted for 80 columns now, source code will gradually aim
  at it too. So far 90 columns were used, and up to 100 tolerated.

Cleanups
--------

- Removed useless manifest and resource file creation under Windows.

  Turns out this is no longer needed at all. Either CPython, MinGW, or Windows
  improved to no longer need it.

- PyLint massive cleanups and annotations bringing down the number of warnings
  by a lot.

- Avoid use of strings and built-ins as run time pre-computed constants that are
  not needed for specific Python versions, or Nuitka modes.

- Do not track needed tuple, list, and dict creation code variants in context,
  but e.g. in ``nuitka.codegen.TupleCodes`` module instead.

- Introduced an "internal" module to host the complex call helper functions,
  instead of just adding it to any module that first uses it.

New Tests
---------

- Added basic tests for order evaluation, where there currently were None.

- Added support for "2to3" execution under Windows too, so we can run tests for
  Python3 installations too.

Summary
-------

The release is clearly major step ahead. The new platform support triggered a
whole range of improvements, and means this is truly complete now.

Also there is very much polish in this release, reducing the number of warnings,
updated documentation, the only thing really missing is visible progress with
optimization.


Nuitka Release 0.4.2
====================

This release comes with many bug fixes, some of which are severe. It also
contains new features, like basic Python 3.3 support. And the `performance
diagrams <http://nuitka.net/pages/performance.html>`__ got expanded.

New Features
------------

- Support for FreeBSD.

  Nuitka works for at least FreeBSD 9.1, older versions may or may not
  work. This required only fixing some "Linuxisms" in the build process.

- New option for warning about compile time detected exception raises.

  Nuitka can now warn about exceptions that will be raised at run time.

- Basic Python3.3 support.

  The test suite of CPython3.2 passes and fails in a compatible way. New feature
  ``yield from`` is not yet supported, and the improved argument parsing error
  messages are not implemented yet.

Bug Fixes
---------

- Nuitka already supported compilation of "main directories", i.e. directories
  with a "__main__.py" file inside. The resulting binary name was "__main__.exe"
  though, but now it is "directory.exe"

  .. code-block:: sh

     # ls directory
     __main__.py

     # nuitka --exe directory
     # ls
     directory directory.exe

  This makes this usage more obvious, and fixes the older issue `Issue#49
  <http://bugs.nuitka.net/issue49>`__ for this feature.

- Evaluation order of binary operators was not enforced.

  Nuitka already enforces evaluation order for just about everything. But not
  for binary operators it seems. Corrects `Issue#61
  <http://bugs.nuitka.net/issue61>`__.

- Providing an ``# coding: no-exist`` was crashing under Python2, and ignored
  under Python3, now it does the compatible thing for both.

- Global statements on the compiler level are legal in Python, and were not
  handled by Nuitka, they now are.

  .. code-block:: python

     global a # Not in a function, but on module level. Pointless but legal!
     a = 1

  Effectively these statements can be ignored. Corrects part of `Issue#65
  <http://bugs.nuitka.net/issue65>`__.

- Future imports are only legal when they are at the start of the file. This was
  not enforced by Nuitka, making it accept code, which CPython would reject. It
  now properly raises a syntax error. Corrects part of `Issue#65
  <http://bugs.nuitka.net/issue65>`__.

- Raising exceptions from context was leaking references.

  .. code-block:: python

     raise ValueError() from None

  Under CPython3.2 the above is not allowed (it is acceptable starting
  CPython3.3), and was also leaking references to its arguments. Corrects
  `Issue#76 <http://bugs.nuitka.net/issue76>`__.

- Importing the module that became ``__main__`` through the module name, didn't
  recurse to it.

  This also gives a warning. PyBench does it, and then stumbles over the
  non-found "pybench" module. Of course, programmers should use ``sys.modules[
  "__main__" ]`` to access main module code. Not only because the duplicated
  modules don't share data. Corrects `Issue#68
  <http://bugs.nuitka.net/issue68>`__.

- Compiled method ``repr`` leaked references when printed.

  When printing them, they would not be freed, and subsequently hold references
  to the object (and class) they belong to. This could trigger bugs for code
  that expects ``__del__`` to run at some point. Corrects `Issue#81
  <http://bugs.nuitka.net/issue81>`__.

- The ``super`` built-in leaked references to given object.

  This was added, because Python3 needs it. It supplies the arguments to
  ``super`` automatically, whereas for Python2 the programmer had to do it. And
  now it turns out that the object lost a reference, causing similar issues as
  above, preventing ``__del__`` to run. Corrects `Issue#81
  <http://bugs.nuitka.net/issue81>`__.

- The ``raise`` statement didn't enforce type of third argument.

  This Python2-only form of exception raising now checks the type of the third
  argument before using it. Plus, when it's None (which is also legal), no
  reference to None is leaked.

- Python3 built-in exceptions were strings instead of exceptions.

  A gross mistake that went uncaught by test suites. I wonder how. Them being
  strings doesn't help their usage of course, fixed. Corrects `Issue#82
  <http://bugs.nuitka.net/issue82>`__.

- The ``-nan`` and ``nan`` both exist and make a difference.

  A older story continued. There is a sign to ``nan``, which can be copied away
  and should be present. This is now also supported by Nuitka. Corrects
  `Issue#75 <http://bugs.nuitka.net/issue75>`__.

- Wrong optimization of ``a == a``, ``a != a``, ``a <= a`` on C++ level.

  While it's not done during Nuitka optimization, the rich comparison helpers
  still contained short cuts for ``==``, ``!=``, and ``<=``.

- The ``sys.executable`` for ``nuitka-python --python-version 3.2`` was still
  ``python``.

  When determining the value for ``sys.executable`` the CPython library code
  looks at the name ``exec`` had received. It was ``python`` in all cases, but
  now it depends on the running version, so it propagates.

- Keyword only functions with default values were loosing references to
  defaults.

  .. code-block:: python

     def f(*, a = X())
        pass

     f()
     f() # Can crash, X() should already be released.

  This is now corrected. Of course, a Python3 only issue.

- Pressing CTRL-C didn't generate ``KeyboardInterrupt`` in compiled code.

  Nuitka never executes "pending calls". It now does, with the upside, that the
  solution used, appears to be suitable for threading in Nuitka too. Expect more
  to come out of this.

- For ``with`` statements with ``return``, ``break``, or ``continue`` to leave
  their body, the ``__exit__`` was not called.

  .. code-block:: python

     with a:      # This called a.__enter__().
         return 2 # This didn't call a.__exit__(None, None, None).

  This is of course quite huge, and unfortunately wasn't covered by any test
  suite so far. Turns out, the re-formulation of ``with`` statements, was
  wrongly using ``try/except/else``, but these ignore the problematic
  statements. Only ``try/finally`` does. The enhanced re-formulation now does
  the correct thing. Corrects `Issue#59 <http://bugs.nuitka.net/issue59>`__.

- Starting with Python3, absolute imports are now the default.

  This was already present for Python3.3, and it turns out that all of Python3
  does it.

New Optimization
----------------

- Constants are now much less often created with ``pickle`` module, but created
  directly.

  This esp. applies for nested constants, now more values become ``is``
  identical instead of only ``==`` identical, which indicates a reduced memory
  usage.

  .. code-block:: python

     a = ("something_special",)
     b = "something_special"

     assert a[0] is b # Now true

  This is not only about memory efficiency, but also about performance. Less
  memory usage is more cache friendly, and the "==" operator will be able to
  shortcut dramatically in cases of identical objects.

  Constants now created without ``pickle`` usage, cover ``float``, ``list``, and
  ``dict``, which is enough for PyStone to not use it at all, which has been
  added support for as well.

- Continue statements might be optimized away.

  A terminal ``continue`` in a loop, was not optimized away:

  .. code-block:: python

     while 1:
         something
         continue   # Now optimized away

  The trailing ``continue`` has no effect and can therefore be removed.

  .. code-block:: python

     while 1:
         something

- Loops with only break statements are optimized away.

  .. code-block:: python

     while 1:
         break

  A loop immediately broken has of course no effect. Loop conditions are
  re-formulated to immediate "if ... : break" checks. Effectively this means
  that loops with conditions detected to be always false to see the loop
  entirely removed.

New Tests
---------

- Added tests for the found issues.

- Running the programs test suite (i.e. recursion) for Python3.2 and Python3.2
  as well, after making adaptation so that the absolute import changes are now
  covered.

- Running the "CPython3.2" test suite with Python3.3 based Nuitka works and
  found a few minor issues.

Organizational
--------------

- The `Downloads <http://nuitka.net/pages/download.html>`__ page now offers RPMs
  for RHEL6, CentOS6, F17, F18, and openSUSE 12.1, 12.2, 12.3. This large
  coverage is thanks to openSUSE build service and "ownssh" for contributing an
  RPM spec file.

  The page got improved with logos for the distributions.

- Added "ownssh" as contributor.

- Revamped the "`User Manual <http://nuitka.net/doc/user-manual.html>`__" in
  terms of layout, structure, and content.

Summary
-------

This release is the result of much validation work. The amount of fixes the
largest of any release so far. New platforms, basic Python3.3 support,
consolidation all around.


Nuitka Release 0.4.1
====================

This release is the first follow-up with a focus on optimization. The major
highlight is progress towards SSA form in the node tree.

Also a lot of cleanups have been performed, for both the tree building, which is
now considered mostly finished, and will be only reviewed. And for the
optimization part there have been large amounts of changes.

New Features
------------

- Python 3.3 experimental support

  * Now compiles many basic tests. Ported the dictionary quick access and update
    code to a more generic and useful interface.

  * Added support for ``__qualname__`` to classes and functions.

  * Small compatibility changes. Some exceptions changed, absolute imports are
    now default, etc.

  * For comparison tests, the hash randomization is disabled.

- Python 3.2 support has been expanded.

  The Python 3.2 on Ubuntu is not providing a helper function that was used by
  Nuitka, replaced it with out own code.

Bug fixes
---------

- Default values were not "is" identical.

  .. code-block:: python

     def defaultKeepsIdentity(arg = "str_value"):
         print arg is "str_value"

     defaultKeepsIdentity()

  This now prints "True" as it does with CPython. The solution is actually a
  general code optimization, see below. `Issue#55
  <http://bugs.nuitka.net/issue55>`__

- Usage of ``unicode`` built-in with more than one argument could corrupt the
  encoding argument string.

  An implementation error of the ``unicode`` was releasing references to
  arguments converted to default encoding, which could corrupt it.

- Assigning Python3 function annotations could cause a segmentation fault.

New Optimization
----------------

- Improved propagation of exception raise statements, eliminating more
  code. They are now also propagated from all kinds of expressions. Previously
  this was more limited. An assertion added will make sure that all raises are
  propagated. Also finally, raise expressions are converted into raise
  statements, but without any normalization.

  .. code-block:: python

     # Now optimizing:
     raise TypeError, 1/0
     # into (minus normalization):
     raise ZeroDivisionError, "integer division or modulo by zero"

     # Now optimizing:
     (1/0).something
     # into (minus normalization):
     raise ZeroDivisionError, "integer division or modulo by zero"

     # Now optimizing:
     function(a, 1/0).something
     # into (minus normalization), notice the side effects of first checking
     # function and a as names to be defined, these may be removed only if
     # they can be demonstrated to have no effect.
     function
     a
     raise ZeroDivisionError, "integer division or modulo by zero"

  There is more examples, where the raise propagation is new, but you get the
  idea.

- Conditional expression nodes are now optimized according to the truth value of
  the condition, and not only for compile time constants. This covers
  e.g. container creations, and other things.

  .. code-block:: python

     # This was already optimized, as it's a compile time constant.
     a if ("a",) else b
     a if True else b

     # These are now optimized, as their truth value is known.
     a if (c,) else b
     a if not (c,) else b

  This is simply taking advantage of infrastructure that now exists. Each node
  kind can overload "getTruthValue" and benefit from it. Help would be welcome
  to review which ones can be added.

- Function creations only have side effects, when their defaults or annotations
  (Python3) do. This allows to remove them entirely, should they be found to be
  unused.

- Code generation for constants now shares element values used in tuples.

  The general case is currently too complex to solve, but we now make sure
  constant tuples (as e.g. used in the default value for the compiled function),
  and string constants share the value. This should reduce memory usage and
  speed up program start-up.

Cleanups
--------

- Optimization was initially designed around visitors that each did one thing,
  and did it well. It turns out though, that this approach is unnecessary, and
  constraint collection, allows for the most consistent results. All remaining
  optimization has been merged into constraint collection.

- The names of modules containing node classes were harmonized to always be
  plural. In the beginning, this was used to convey the information that only a
  single node kind would be contained, but that has long changed, and is
  unimportant information.

- The class names of nodes were stripped from the "CPython" prefix. Originally
  the intent was to express strict correlation to CPython, but with increasing
  amounts of re-formulations, this was not used at all, and it's also not
  important enough to dominate the class name.

- The re-formulations performed in tree building have moved out of the
  "Building" module, into names "ReformulationClasses" e.g., so they are easier
  to locate and review. Helpers for node building are now in a separate module,
  and generally it's much easier to find the content of interest now.

- Added new re-formulation of ``print`` statements. The conversion to strings is
  now made explicit in the node tree.

New Tests
---------

- Added test to cover default value identity.

Organizational
--------------

- The upload of `Nuitka to PyPI <http://pypi.python.org/pypi/Nuitka/>`__ has
  been repaired and now properly displays project information again.

Summary
-------

The quicker release is mostly a consolidation effort, without actual performance
progress. The progress towards SSA form matter a lot on the outlook front. Once
this is finished, standard compiler algorithms can be added to Nuitka which go
beyond the current peephole optimization.


Nuitka Release 0.4.0
====================

This release brings massive progress on all fronts. The big highlight is of
course: Full Python3.2 support. With this release, the test suite of CPython3.2
is considered passing when compiled with Nuitka.

Then lots of work on optimization and infrastructure. The major goal of this
release was to get in shape for actual optimization. This is also why for the
first time, it is tested that some things are indeed compile time optimized to
spot regressions easier. And we are having performance diagrams, `even if weak
ones <http://nuitka.net/pages/performance.html>`__:

New Features
------------

- Python3.2 is now fully supported.

  - Fully correct ``metaclass =`` semantics now correctly supported. It had been
    working somewhat previously, but now all the corner cases are covered too.

  - Keyword only parameters.

  - Annotations of functions return value and their arguments.

  - Exception causes, chaining, automatic deletion of exception handlers ``as``
    values.

  - Added support for starred assigns.

  - Unicode variable names are also supported, although it's of course ugly, to
    find a way to translate these to C++ ones.

Bug fixes
---------

- Checking compiled code with ``instance(some_function, types.FunctionType)`` as
  "zope.interfaces" does, was causing compatibility problems. Now this kind of
  check passes for compiled functions too. `Issue#53
  <http://bugs.nuitka.net/issue53>`__

- The frame of modules had an empty locals dictionary, which is not compatible
  to CPython which puts the globals dictionary there too. Also discussed in
  `Issue#53 <http://bugs.nuitka.net/issue53>`__

- For nested exceptions and interactions with generator objects, the exceptions
  in "sys.exc_info()" were not always fully compatible. They now are.

- The ``range`` builtin was not raising exceptions if given arguments appeared
  to not have side effects, but were still illegal, e.g. ``range([], 1, -1)``
  was optimized away if the value was not used.

- Don't crash on imported modules with syntax errors. Instead, the attempted
  recursion is simply not done.

- Doing a ``del`` on ``__defaults`` and ``__module__`` of compiled functions was
  crashing. This was noticed by a Python3 test for ``__kwdefaults__`` that
  exposed this compiled functions weakness.

- Wasn't detecting duplicate arguments, if one of them was not a plain
  arguments. Star arguments could collide with normal ones.

- The ``__doc__`` of classes is now only set, where it was in fact
  specified. Otherwise it only polluted the name space of ``locals()``.

- When ``return`` from the tried statements of a ``try/finally`` block, was
  overridden, by the final block, a reference was leaked. Example code:

  .. code-block:: python

     try:
         return 1
     finally:
         return 2

- Raising exception instances with value, was leaking references, and not
  raising the ``TypeError`` error it is supposed to do.

- When raising with multiple arguments, the evaluation order of them was not
  enforced, it now is. This fixes a reference leak when raising exceptions,
  where building the exception was raising an exception.

New Optimization
----------------

- Optimizing attribute access to compile time constants for the first time. The
  old registry had no actual user yet.

- Optimizing subscript and slices for all compile time constants beyond constant
  values, made easy by using inheritance.

- Built-in references now convert to strings directly, e.g. when used in a print
  statement. Needed for the testing approach "compiled file contains only prints
  with constant value".

- Optimizing calls to constant nodes directly into exceptions.

- Optimizing built-in ``bool`` for arguments with known truth value. This would
  be creations of tuples, lists, and dictionaries.

- Optimizing ``a is b`` and ``a is not b`` based on aliasing interface, which at
  this time effectively is limited to telling that ``a is a`` is true and ``a is
  not a`` is false, but this will expand.

- Added support for optimizing ``hasattr``, ``getattr``, and ``setattr``
  built-ins as well. The ``hasattr`` was needed for the ``class`` re-formulation
  of Python3 anyway.

- Optimizing ``getattr`` with string argument and no default to simple attribute
  access.

- Added support for optimizing ``isinstance`` built-in.

- Was handling "BreakException" and "ContinueException" in all loops that used
  ``break`` or ``continue`` instead of only where necessary.

- When catching "ReturnValueException", was raising an exception where a normal
  return was sufficient. Raising them now only where needed, which also means,
  function need not catch them ever.

Cleanups
--------

- The handling of classes for Python2 and Python3 have been re-formulated in
  Python more completely.

  * The calling of the determined "metaclass" is now in the node tree, so this
    call may possible to in-line in the future. This eliminated some static C++
    code.

  * Passing of values into dictionary creation function is no longer using hard
    coded special parameters, but temporary variables can now have closure
    references, making this normal and visible to the optimization.

  * Class dictionary creation functions are therefore no longer as special as
    they used to be.

  * There is no class creation node anymore, it's merely a call to ``type`` or
    the metaclass detected.

- Re-formulated complex calls through helper functions that process the star
  list and dict arguments and do merges, checks, etc.

  * Moves much C++ code into the node tree visibility.

  * Will allow optimization to eliminate checks and to compile time merge, once
    in-line functions and loop unrolling are supported.

- Added "return None" to function bodies without a an aborting statement at the
  end, and removed the hard coded fallback from function templates. Makes it
  explicit in the node tree and available for optimization.

- Merged C++ classes for frame exception keeper with frame guards.

  * The exception is now saved in the compiled frame object, making it
    potentially more compatible to start with.

  * Aligned module and function frame guard usage, now using the same class.

  * There is now a clear difference in the frame guard classes. One is for
    generators and one is for functions, allowing to implement their different
    exception behavior there.

- The optimization registries for calls, subscripts, slices, and attributes have
  been replaced with attaching them to nodes.

  * The ensuing circular dependency has been resolved by more local imports for
    created nodes.

  * The package "nuitka.transform.optimization.registries" is no more.

  * New per node methods "computeNodeCall", "computeNodeSubscript",
    etc. dispatch the optimization process to the nodes directly.

- Use the standard frame guard code generation for modules too.

  * Added a variant "once", that avoids caching of frames entirely.

- The variable closure taking has been cleaned up.

  * Stages are now properly numbered.

  * Python3 only stage is not executed for Python2 anymore.

  * Added comments explaining things a bit better.

  * Now an early step done directly after building a tree.

- The special code generation used for unpacking from iterators and catching
  "StopIteration" was cleaned up.

  * Now uses template, Generator functions, and proper identifiers.

- The ``return`` statements in generators are now re-formulated into ``raise
  StopIteration`` for generators, because that's what they really are. Allowed
  to remove special handling of ``return`` nodes in generators.

- The specialty of CPython2.6 yielding non-None values of lambda generators, was
  so far implemented in code generation. This was moved to tree building as a
  re-formulation, making it subject to normal optimization.

- Mangling of attribute names in functions contained in classes, has been moved
  into the early tree building. So far it was done during code generation,
  making it invisible to the optimization stages.

- Removed tags attribute from node classes. This was once intended to make up
  for non-inheritance of similar node kinds, but since we have function
  references, the structure got so clean, it's no more needed.

- Introduced new package ``nuitka.tree``, where the building of node trees, and
  operations on them live, as well as recursion and variable closure.

- Removed ``nuitka.transform`` and move its former children
  ``nuitka.optimization`` and ``nuitka.finalization`` one level up. The deeply
  nested structure turned out to have no advantage.

- Checks for Python version was sometimes "> 300", where of course ">= 300" is
  the only thing that makes sense.

- Split out helper code for exception raising from the handling of exception
  objects.

New Tests
---------

- The complete CPython3.2 test suite was adapted (no ``__code__``, no
  ``__closure__``, etc.) and is now passing, but only without "--debug", because
  otherwise some of the generated C++ triggers (harmless) warnings.

- Added new test suite designed to prove that expressions that are known to be
  compile time constant are indeed so. This works using the XML output done with
  "--dump-xml" and then searching it to only have print statements with constant
  values.

- Added new basic CPython3.2 test "Functions32" and "ParameterErrors32" to cover
  keyword only parameter handling.

- Added tests to cover generator object and exception interactions.

- Added tests to cover ``try/finally`` and ``return`` in one or both branches
  correctly handling the references.

- Added tests to cover evaluation order of arguments when raising exceptions.

Organizational
--------------

- Changed my email from GMX over to Gmail, the old one will still continue to
  work. Updated the copyright notices accordingly.

- Uploaded `Nuitka to PyPI <http://pypi.python.org/pypi/Nuitka/>`__ as well.

Summary
-------

This release marks a milestone. The support of Python3 is here. The
re-formulation of complex calls, and the code generation improvements are quite
huge. More re-formulation could be done for argument parsing, but generally this
is now mostly complete.

The 0.3.x series had a lot releases. Many of which brought progress with
re-formulations that aimed at making optimization easier or possible. Sometimes
small things like making "return None" explicit. Sometimes bigger things, like
making class creations normal functions, or getting rid of ``or`` and
``and``. All of this was important ground work, to make sure, that optimization
doesn't deal with complex stuff.

So, the 0.4.x series begins with this. The focus from now on can be almost
purely optimization. This release contains already some of it, with frames being
optimized away, with the assignment keepers from the ``or`` and ``and``
re-formulation being optimized away. This will be about achieving goals from the
"ctypes" plan as discussed in the developer manual.

Also the performance page will be expanded with more benchmarks and diagrams as
I go forward. I have finally given up on "codespeed", and do my own diagrams.


Nuitka Release 0.3.25
=====================

This release brings about changes on all fronts, bug fixes, new features. Also
very importantly Nuitka no longer uses C++11 for its code, but mere C++03. There
is new re-formulation work, and re-factoring of functions.

But the most important part is this: Mercurial unit tests are
working. Nearly. With the usual disclaimer of me being wrong, all remaining
errors are errors of the test, or minor things. Hope is that these unit tests
can be added as release tests to Nuitka. And once that is done, the next big
Python application can come.

Bug fixes
---------

- Local variables were released when an exception was raised that escaped the
  local function. They should only be released, after another exception was
  raised somewhere. `Issue#39 <http://bugs.nuitka.net/issue39>`__.

- Identifiers of nested tuples and lists could collide.

  .. code-block:: python

     a = ((1, 2), 3)
     b = ((1,), 2, 3)

  Both tuples had the same name previously, not the end of the tuple is marked
  too. Fixed in 0.3.24.1 already.

- The ``__name__`` when used read-only in modules in packages was optimized to a
  string value that didn't contain the package name.

- Exceptions set when entering compiled functions were unset at function exit.

New Features
------------

- Compiled frames support. Before, Nuitka was creating frames with the standard
  CPython C/API functions, and tried its best to cache them. This involved some
  difficulties, but as it turns out, it is actually possible to instead provide
  a compatible type of our own, that we have full control over.

  This will become the base of enhanced compatibility. Keeping references to
  local variables attached to exception tracebacks is something we may be able
  to solve now.

- Enhanced Python3 support, added support for ``nonlocal`` declarations and many
  small corrections for it.

- Writable ``__defaults__`` attribute for compiled functions, actually changes
  the default value used at call time. Not supported is changing the amount of
  default parameters.

Cleanups
--------

- Keep the functions along with the module and added "FunctionRef" node kind to
  point to them.

- Reformulated ``or`` and ``and`` operators with the conditional expression
  construct which makes the "short-circuit" branch.

- Access ``self`` in methods from the compiled function object instead of
  pointer to context object, making it possible to access the function object.

- Removed "OverflowCheck" module and its usage, avoids one useless scan per
  function to determine the need for "locals dictionary".

- Make "compileTree" of "MainControl" module to only do what the name says and
  moved the rest out, making the top level control clearer.

- Don't export module entry points when building executable and not
  modules. These exports cause MinGW and MSVC compilers to create export
  libraries.

New Optimization
----------------

- More efficient code for conditional expressions in conditions:

.. code-block:: python

   if a if b else c

  See above, this code is now the typical pattern for each ``or`` and ``and``,
  so this was much needed now.

Organizational
--------------

- The remaining uses of C++11 have been removed. Code generated with Nuitka and
  complementary C++ code now compile with standard C++03 compilers. This lowers
  the Nuitka requirements and enables at least g++ 4.4 to work with Nuitka.

- The usages of the GNU extension operation ``a ?: b`` have replaced with
  standard C++ constructs. This is needed to support MSVC which doesn't have
  this.

- Added examples for the typical use cases to the "`User Manual
  <http://nuitka.net/doc/user-manual.html>`__".

- The "compare_with_cpython" script has gained an option to immediately remove
  the Nuitka outputs (build directory and binary) if successful. Also the
  temporary files are now put under "/var/tmp" if available.

- Debian package improvements, registering with "doc-base" the "`User Manual
  <http://nuitka.net/doc/user-manual.html>`__" so it is easier to discover. Also
  suggest "mingw32" package which provides the cross compiler to Windows.

- Partial support for MSVC (Visual Studio 2008 to be exact, the version that
  works with CPython2.6 and CPython2.7).

  All basic tests that do not use generators are working now, but those will
  currently cause crashes.

- Renamed the ``--g++-only`` option to ``--c++-only``.

  The old name is no longer correct after clang and MSVC have gained support,
  and it could be misunderstood to influence compiler selection, rather than
  causing the C++ source code to not be updated, so manual changes will the
  used. This solves `Issue#47 <http://bugs.nuitka.net/issue47>`__.

- Catch exceptions for ``continue``, ``break``, and ``return`` only where needed
  for ``try``/``finally`` and loop constructs.

New Tests
---------

- Added CPython3.2 test suite as "tests/CPython32" from 3.2.3 and run it with
  CPython2.7 to check that Nuitka gives compatible error messages. It is not
  expected to pass yet on Python3.2, but work will be done towards this goal.

- Make CPython2.7 test suite runner also execute the generated "doctest"
  modules.

- Enabled tests for default parameters and their reference counts.

Summary
-------

This release marks an important point. The compiled frames are exciting new
technology, that will allow even better integration with CPython, while
improving speed. Lowering the requirements to C++03 means, we will become usable
on Android and with MSVC, which will make adoption of Nuitka on Windows easier
for many.

Structurally the outstanding part is the function as references cleanup. This
was a blocker for value propagation, because now functions references can be
copied, whereas previously this was duplicating the whole function body, which
didn't work, and wasn't acceptable. Now, work can resume in this domain.

Also very exciting when it comes to optimization is the remove of special code
for ``or`` and ``and`` operators, as these are now only mere conditional
expressions. Again, this will make value propagation easier with two special
cases less.

And then of course, with Mercurial unit tests running compiled with Nuitka, an
important milestone has been hit.

For a while now, the focus will be on completing Python3 support, XML based
optimization regression tests, benchmarks, and other open ends. Once that is
done, and more certainty about Mercurial tests support, I may call it a 0.4 and
start with local type inference for actual speed gains.


Nuitka Release 0.3.24
=====================

This release contains progress on many fronts, except performance.

The extended coverage from running the CPython 2.7 and CPython 3.2 (partially)
test suites shows in a couple of bug fixes and general improvements in
compatibility.

Then there is a promised new feature that allows to compile whole packages.

Also there is more Python3 compatibility, the CPython 3.2 test suite now
succeeds up to "test_builtin.py", where it finds that ``str`` doesn't support
the new parameters it has gained, future releases will improve on this.

And then of course, more re-formulation work, in this case, class definitions
are now mere simple functions. This and later function references, is the
important and only progress towards type inference.

Bug fixes
---------

- The compiled method type can now be used with ``copy`` module. That means,
  instances with methods can now be copied too. `Issue#40
  <http://bugs.nuitka.net/issue40>`__. Fixed in 0.3.23.1 already.

- The ``assert`` statement as of Python2.7 creates the ``AssertionError`` object
  from a given value immediately, instead of delayed as it was with
  Python2.6. This makes a difference for the form with 2 arguments, and if the
  value is a tuple. `Issue#41 <http://bugs.nuitka.net/issue41>`__. Fixed in
  0.3.23.1 already.

- Sets written like this didn't work unless they were predicted at compile time:

  .. code-block:: python

     { value }

  This apparently rarely used Python2.7 syntax didn't have code generation yet
  and crashed the compiler. `Issue#42 <http://bugs.nuitka.net/issue42>`__. Fixed
  in 0.3.23.1 already.

- For Python2, the default encoding for source files is ``ascii``, and it is now
  enforced by Nuitka as well, with the same ``SyntaxError``.

- Corner cases of ``exec`` statements with nested functions now give proper
  ``SyntaxError`` exceptions under Python2.

- The ``exec`` statement with a tuple of length 1 as argument, now also gives a
  ``TypeError`` exception under Python2.

- For Python2, the ``del`` of a closure variable is a ``SyntaxError``.

New Features
------------

- Added support creating compiled packages. If you give Nuitka a directory with
  an "__init__.py" file, it will compile that package into a ".so" file. Adding
  the package contents with ``--recurse-dir`` allows to compile complete
  packages now. Later there will be a cleaner interface likely, where the later
  is automatic.

- Added support for providing directories as main programs. It's OK if they
  contain a "__main__.py" file, then it's used instead, otherwise give
  compatible error message.

- Added support for optimizing the ``super`` built-in. It was already working
  correctly, but not optimized on CPython2. But for CPython3, the variant
  without any arguments required dedicated code.

- Added support for optimizing the ``unicode`` built-in under Python2. It was
  already working, but will become the basis for the ``str`` built-in of Python3
  in future releases.

- For Python3, lots of compatibility work has been done. The Unicode issues
  appear to be ironed out now. The ``del`` of closure variables is allowed and
  supported now. Built-ins like ``ord`` and ``chr`` work more correctly and
  attributes are now interned strings, so that monkey patching classes works.

Organizational
--------------

- Migrated "bin/benchmark.sh" to Python as "misc/run-valgrind.py" and made it a
  bit more portable that way. Prefers "/var/tmp" if it exists and creates
  temporary files in a secure manner. Triggered by the Debian "insecure temp
  file" bug.

- Migrated "bin/make-dependency-graph.sh" to Python as
  "misc/make-dependency-graph.py" and made a more portable and powerful that
  way.

  The filtering is done a more robust way. Also it creates temporary files in a
  secure manner, also triggered by the Debian "insecure temp file" bug.

  And it creates SVG files and no longer PostScript as the first one is more
  easily rendered these days.

- Removed the "misc/gist" git sub-module, which was previously used by
  "misc/make-doc.py" to generate HTML from "`User Manual
  <http://nuitka.net/doc/user-manual.html>`__" and "`Developer Manual
  <http://nuitka.net/doc/developer-manual.html>`__".

  These are now done with Nikola, which is much better at it and it integrates
  with the web site.

- Lots of formatting improvements to the change log, and manuals:

  * Marking identifiers with better suited ReStructured Text markup.
  * Added links to the bug tracker all Issues.
  * Unified wordings, quotation, across the documents.

Cleanups
--------

- The creation of the class dictionaries is now done with normal function
  bodies, that only needed to learn how to throw an exception when directly
  called, instead of returning ``NULL``.

  Also the assignment of ``__module__`` and ``__doc__`` in these has become
  visible in the node tree, allowing their proper optimization.

  These re-formulation changes allowed to remove all sorts of special treatment
  of ``class`` code in the code generation phase, making things a lot simpler.

- There was still a declaration of ``PRINT_ITEMS`` and uses of it, but no
  definition of it.

- Code generation for "main" module and "other" modules are now merged, and no
  longer special.

- The use of raw strings was found unnecessary and potentially still buggy and
  has been removed. The dependence on C++11 is getting less and less.

New Tests
---------

- Updated CPython2.6 test suite "tests/CPython26" to 2.6.8, adding tests for
  recent bug fixes in CPython. No changes to Nuitka were needed in order to
  pass, which is always good news.

- Added CPython2.7 test suite as "tests/CPython27" from 2.7.3, making it public
  for the first time. Previously a private copy of some age, with many no longer
  needed changes had been used by me. Now it is up to par with what was done
  before for "tests/CPython26", so this pending action is finally done.

- Added test to cover Python2 syntax error of having a function with closure
  variables nested inside a function that is an overflow function.

- Added test "BuiltinSuper" to cover ``super`` usage details.

- Added test to cover ``del`` on nested scope as syntax error.

- Added test to cover ``exec`` with a tuple argument of length 1.

- Added test to cover ``barry_as_FLUFL`` future import to work.

- Removed "Unicode" from known error cases for CPython3.2, it's now working.

Summary
-------

This release brought forward the most important remaining re-formulation changes
needed for Nuitka. Removing class bodies, makes optimization yet again
simpler. Still, making function references, so they can be copied, is missing
for value propagation to progress.

Generally, as usual, a focus has been laid on correctness. This is also the
first time, I am release with a known bug though: That is `Issue#39
<http://bugs.nuitka.net/issue39>`__ which I believe now, may be the root cause
of the mercurial tests not yet passing.

The solution will be involved and take a bit of time. It will be about "compiled
frames" and be a (invasive) solution. It likely will make Nuitka faster too. But
this release includes lots of tiny improvements, for Python3 and also for
Python2. So I wanted to get this out now.

As usual, please check it out, and let me know how you fare.


Nuitka Release 0.3.23
=====================

This release is the one that completes the Nuitka "sun rise phase".

All of Nuitka is now released under `Apache License 2.0
<http://www.apache.org/licenses/LICENSE-2.0>`__ which is a very liberal license,
and compatible with basically all Free Software licenses there are. It's only
asking to allow integration, of what you send back, and patent grants for the
code.

In the first phase of Nuitka development, I wanted to keep control over Nuitka,
so it wouldn't repeat mistakes of other projects. This is no longer a concern
for me, it's not going to happen anymore.

I would like to thank Debian Legal team, for originally bringing to my
attention, that this license will be better suited, than any copyright
assignment could be.

Bug fixes
---------

- The compiled functions could not be used with ``multiprocessing`` or
  ``copy.copy``. `Issue#19 <http://bugs.nuitka.net/issue19>`__. Fixed in
  0.3.22.1 already.

- In-place operations for slices with not both bounds specified crashed the
  compiler. `Issue#36 <http://bugs.nuitka.net/issue36>`__. Fixed in 0.3.22.1
  already.

- Cyclic imports could trigger an endless loop, because module import
  expressions became the parent of the imported module object. `Issue#37
  <http://bugs.nuitka.net/issue37>`__. Fixed in 0.3.22.2 already.

- Modules named ``proc`` or ``func`` could not be compiled to modules or
  embedded due to a collision with identifiers of CPython2.7 includes. `Issue#38
  <http://bugs.nuitka.net/issue38>`__. Fixed in 0.3.22.2 already.

New Features
------------

- The fix for `Issue#19 <http://bugs.nuitka.net/issue19>`__ also makes pickling
  of compiled functions available. As it is the case for non-compiled functions
  in CPython, no code objects are stored, only names of module level variables.

Organizational
--------------

- Using the Apache License 2.0 for all of Nuitka now.

- Speedcenter has been re-activated, but is not yet having a lot of benchmarks
  yet, subject to change.

  .. admonition:: Update

     We have given up on speedcenter meanwhile, and generate static pages with
     graphs instead.

New Tests
---------

- Changed the "CPython26" tests to no longer disable the parts that relied on
  copying of functions to work, as `Issue#19 <http://bugs.nuitka.net/issue19>`__
  is now supported.

- Extended in-place assignment tests to cover error cases of `Issue#36
  <http://bugs.nuitka.net/issue36>`__.

- Extended compile library test to also try and compile the path where ``numpy``
  lives. This is apparently another path, where Debian installs some modules,
  and compiling this would have revealed `Issue#36
  <http://bugs.nuitka.net/issue36>`__ sooner.

Summary
-------

The release contains bug fixes, and the huge step of changing `the license
<http://www.apache.org/licenses/LICENSE-2.0>`__. It is made in preparation to
`PyCON EU <https://ep2012.europython.eu>`__.


Nuitka Release 0.3.22
=====================

This release is a continuation of the trend of previous releases, and added more
re-formulations of Python that lower the burden on code generation and
optimization.

It also improves Python3 support substantially. In fact this is the first
release to not only run itself under Python3, but for Nuitka to *compile itself*
with Nuitka under Python3, which previously only worked for Python2. For the
common language subset, it's quite fine now.

Bug fixes
---------

- List contractions produced extra entries on the call stack, after they became
  functions, these are no more existent. That was made possible my making frame
  stack entries an optional element in the node tree, left out for list
  contractions.

- Calling a compiled function in an exception handler cleared the exception on
  return, it no longer does that.

- Reference counter handling with generator ``throw`` method is now correct.

- A module "builtins" conflicted with the handling of the Python ``builtins``
  module. Those now use different identifiers.

New Features
------------

- New ``metaclass`` syntax for the ``class`` statement works, and the old
  ``__metaclass__`` attribute is properly ignored.

  .. code-block:: python

     # Metaclass syntax in Python3, illegal in Python2
     class X(metaclass = Y):
         pass

  .. code-block:: python

     # Metaclass syntax in Python2, no effect in Python3
     class X:
         __metaclass__ = Y

  .. note::

     The way to make a use of a metaclass in a portable way, is to create a
     based class that has it and then inherit from it. Sad, isn' it. Surely, the
     support for ``__metaclass__`` could still live.

     .. code-block:: python

        # For Python2/3 compatible source, we create a base class that has the
        # metaclass used and doesn't require making a choice.

        CPythonNodeMetaClassBase = NodeCheckMetaClass(
            "CPythonNodeMetaClassBase",
            (object,),
            {}
        )

- The ``--dump-xml`` option works with Nuitka running under Python3. This was
  not previously supported.

- Python3 now also has compatible parameter errors and compatible exception
  error messages.

- Python3 has changed scope rules for list contractions (assignments don't
  affect outside values) and this is now respected as well.

- Python3 has gained support for recursive programs and stand alone extension
  modules, these are now both possible as well.

New Optimization
----------------

- Avoid frame stack entries for functions that cannot raise exceptions,
  i.e. where they would not be used.

  This avoids overhead for the very simple functions. And example of this can be
  seen here:

  .. code-block:: python

     def simple():
        return 7

- Optimize ``len`` built-in for non-constant, but known length values.

  An example can be seen here:

  .. code-block:: python

     # The range isn't constructed at compile time, but we still know its
     # length.
     len(range(10000000))

     # The string isn't constructed at compile time, but we still know its
     # length.
     len("*" * 1000)

     # The tuple isn't constructed, instead it's known length is used, and
     # side effects are maintained.
     len((a(), b()))

  This new optimization applies to all kinds of container creations and the
  ``range`` built-in initially.

- Optimize conditions for non-constant, but known truth values.

  At this time, known truth values of non-constants means ``range`` built-in
  calls with know size and container creations.

  An example can be seen here:

  .. code-block:: python

     if (a,):
        print "In Branch"

  It's clear, that the tuple will be true, we just need to maintain the side
  effect, which we do.

- Optimize ``or`` and ``and`` operators for known truth values.

  See above for what has known truth values currently. This will be most useful
  to predict conditions that need not be evaluated at all due to short circuit
  nature, and to avoid checking against constant values. Previously this could
  not be optimized, but now it can:

  .. code-block:: python

     # The access and call to "something()" cannot possibly happen
     0 and something()

     # Can be replaced with "something()", as "1" is true. If it had a side
     # effect, it would be maintained.
     1 and something()

     # The access and call to "something()" cannot possibly happen, the value
     # is already decided, it's "1".
     1 or something()

     # Can be replaced with "something()", as "0" is false. If it had a side
     # effect, it would be maintained.
     0 or something()

- Optimize print arguments to become strings.

  The arguments to ``print`` statements are now converted to strings at compile
  time if possible.

  .. code-block:: python

     print 1

  becomes:

  .. code-block:: python

     print "1"

- Combine print arguments to single ones.

  When multiple strings are printed, these are now combined.

  .. code-block:: python

     print "1+1=", 1+1

  becomes:

  .. code-block:: python

     print "1+1= 2"

Organizational
--------------

- Enhanced Python3 support, enabling support for most basic tests.

- Check files with PyLint in deterministic (alphabetical) order.

Cleanups
--------

- Frame stack entries are now part of the node tree instead of part of the
  template for every function, generator, class or module.

- The ``try``/``except``/``else`` has been re-formulated to use an indicator
  variable visible in the node tree, that tells if a handler has been executed
  or not.

- Side effects are now a dedicated node, used in several optimization to
  maintain the effect of an expression with known value.

New Tests
---------

- Expanded and adapted basic tests to work for Python3 as well.

- Added reference count tests for generator functions ``throw``, ``send``, and
  ``close`` methods.

- Cover calling a function with ``try``/``except`` in an exception handler
  twice. No test was previously doing that.

Summary
-------

This release offers enhanced compatibility with Python3, as well as the solution
to many structural problems. Calculating lengths of large non-constant values at
compile time, is technically a break through, as is avoiding lengthy
calculations. The frame guards as nodes is a huge improvement, making that
costly operational possible to be optimized away.

There still is more work ahead, before value propagation will be safe enough to
enable, but we are seeing the glimpse of it already. Not for long, and looking
at numbers will make sense.


Nuitka Release 0.3.21
=====================

This releases contains some really major enhancements, all heading towards
enabling value propagation inside Nuitka. Assignments of all forms are now all
simple and explicit, and as a result, now it will be easy to start tracking
them.

Contractions have become functions internally, with statements use temporary
variables, complex unpacking statement were reduced to more simple ones, etc.

Also there are the usual few small bug fixes, and a bunch of organizational
improvements, that make the release complete.

Bug fixes
---------

- The built-in ``next`` could causes a program crash when iterating past the end
  of an iterator. `Issue#34 <http://bugs.nuitka.net/issue34>`__. Fixed in
  0.3.20.1 already.

- The ``set`` constants could cause a compiler error, as that type was not
  considered in the "mutable" check yet. Fixed in 0.3.20.2 already.

- Performance regression. Optimize expression for exception types caught as well
  again, this was lost in last release.

- Functions that contain ``exec``, are supposed to have a writable locals. But
  when removing that ``exec`` statement as part of optimization, this property
  of the function could get lost.

- The so called "overflow functions" are once again correctly handled. These
  once were left behind in some refactoring and had not been repaired until
  now. An overflow function is a nested function with an ``exec`` or a star
  import.

- The syntax error for ``return`` outside of a function, was not given, instead
  the code returned at run time. Fixed to raise a ``SyntaxError`` at compile
  time.

New Optimization
----------------

- Avoid ``tuple`` objects to be created when catching multiple exception types,
  instead call exception match check function multiple times.

- Removal of dead code following ``break``, ``continue``, ``return``, and
  ``raise``. Code that follows these statements, or conditional statements,
  where all branches end with it.

  .. note::

      These may not actually occur often in actual code, but future
      optimization may produce them more frequently, and their removal may in
      turn make other possible optimization.

- Detect module variables as "read only" after all writes have been detected to
  not be executed as removed. Previously the "read only indicator" was
  determined only once and then stayed the same.

- Expanded conditional statement optimization to detect cases, where condition
  is a compile time constant, not just a constant value.

- Optimize away assignments from a variable to the same variable, they have no
  effect. The potential side effect of accessing the variable is left intact
  though, so exceptions will be raised still.

  .. note::

     An exception is where ``len = len`` actually does have an impact, because
     that variable becomes assignable. The "compile itself" test of Nuitka found
     that to happen with ``long`` from the ``nuitka.__past__`` module.

- Created Python3 variant of quick ``unicode`` string access, there was no such
  thing in the CPython C/API, but we make the distinction in the source code, so
  it makes sense to have it.

- Created an optimized implementation for the built-in ``iter`` with 2
  parameters as well. This allows for slightly more efficient code to be created
  with regards to reference handling, rather than using the CPython C/API.

- For all types of variable assigned in the generated code, there are now
  methods that accept already taken references or not, and the code generator
  picks the optimal variant. This avoids the drop of references, that e.g. the
  local variable will insist to take.

- Don't use a "context" object for generator functions (and generator
  expressions) that don't need one. And even if it does to store e.g. the given
  parameter values, avoid to have a "common context" if there is no closure
  taken. This avoids useless ``malloc`` calls and speeds up repeated generator
  object creation.

Organizational
--------------

- Changed the Scons build file database to reside in the build directory as
  opposed to the current directory, not polluting it anymore. Thanks for the
  patch go to Michael H Kent, very much appreciated.

- The ``--experimental`` option is no longer available outside of checkouts of
  git, and even there not on stable branches (``master``, ``hotfix/...``). It
  only pollutes ``--help`` output as stable releases have no experimental code
  options, not even development version will make a difference.

- The binary "bin/Nuitka.py" has been removed from the git repository. It was
  deprecated a while ago, not part of the distribution and served no good use,
  as it was a symbolic link only anyway.

- The ``--python-version`` option is applied at Nuitka start time to re-launch
  Nuitka with the given Python version, to make sure that the Python run time
  used for computations and link time Python versions are the same. The allowed
  values are now checked (2.6, 2.7 and 3.2) and the user gets a nice error with
  wrong values.

- Added ``--keep-pythonpath`` alias for ``--execute-with-pythonpath`` option,
  probably easier to remember.

- Support ``--debug`` with clang, so it can also be used to check the generated
  code for all warnings, and perform assertions. Didn't report anything new.

- The contents environment variable ``CXX`` determines the default C++ compiler
  when set, so that checking with ``CXX=g++-4.7 nuitka-python ...`` has become
  supported.

- The ``check-with-pylint`` script now has a real command line option to control
  the display of ``TODO`` items.

Cleanups
--------

- Changed complex assignments, i.e. assignments with multiple targets to such
  using a temporary variable and multiple simple assignments instead.

  .. code-block:: python

     a = b = c

  .. code-block:: python

     _tmp = c
     b = _tmp
     a = _tmp

  In CPython, when one assignment raises an exception, the whole thing is
  aborted, so the complexity of having multiple targets is no more needed, now
  that we have temporary variables in a block.

  All that was really needed, was to evaluate the complete source expression
  only once, but that made code generation contain ugly loops that are no more
  needed.

- Changed unpacking assignments to use temporary variables. Code like this:

  .. code-block:: python

     a, b = c

  Is handled more like this:

  .. code-block:: python

     _tmp_iter = iter(c)
     _tmp1 = next(_tmp_iter)
     _tmp2 = next(_tmp_iter)
     if not finished(_tmp_iter):
         raise ValueError("too many values to unpack")
     a = _tmp1
     b = _tmp2

  In reality, not really ``next`` is used, as it wouldn't raise the correct
  exception for unpacking, and the ``finished`` check is more condensed into it.

  Generally this cleanup allowed that the ``AssignTargetTuple`` and associated
  code generation was removed, and in the future value propagation may optimize
  these ``next`` and ``iter`` calls away where possible. At this time, this is
  not done yet.

- Exception handlers assign caught exception value through assignment statement.

  Previously the code generated for assigning from the caught exception was not
  considered part of the handler. It now is the first statement of an exception
  handler or not present, this way it may be optimized as well.

- Exception handlers now explicitly catch more than one type.

  Catching multiple types worked by merits of the created tuple object working
  with the Python C/API function called, but that was not explicit at all. Now
  every handler has a tuple of exceptions it catches, which may only be one, or
  if None, it's all.

- Contractions are now functions as well.

  Contractions (list, dict, and set) are now re-formulated as function bodies
  that contain for loops and conditional statements. This allowed to remove a
  lot of special code that dealt with them and will make these easier to
  understand for optimization and value propagation.

- Global is handled during tree building.

  Previously the global statement was its own node, which got removed during the
  optimization phase in a dedicated early optimization that applied its effect,
  and then removed the node.

  It was determined, that there is no reason to not immediately apply the effect
  of the global variable and take closure variables and add them to the provider
  of that ``global`` statement, allowing to remove the node class.

- Read only module variable detection integrated to constraint collection.

  The detection of read only module variables was so far done as a separate
  step, which is no more necessary as the constraint collection tracks the
  usages of module variables anyway, so this separate and slow step could be
  removed.

New Tests
---------

- Added test to cover order of calls for complex assignments that unpack, to see
  that they make a fresh iterator for each part of a complex assignment.

- Added test that unpacks in an exception catch. It worked, due to the generic
  handling of assignment targets by Nuitka, and I didn't even know it can be
  done, example:

  .. code-block:: python

     try:
         raise ValueError(1,2)
     except ValueError as (a,b):
         print "Unpacking caught exception and unpacked", a, b

  Will assign ``a=1`` and ``b=2``.

- Added test to cover return statements on module level and class level, they
  both must give syntax errors.

- Cover exceptions from accessing unassigned global names.

- Added syntax test to show that star imports do not allow other names to be
  imported at the same time as well.

- Python3 is now also running the compile itself test successfully.

Summary
-------

The progress made towards value propagation and type inference is *very*
significant, and makes those appears as if they are achievable.


Nuitka Release 0.3.20
=====================

This time there are a few bug fixes and some really major cleanups, lots of new
optimization and preparations for more. And then there is a new compiler clang
and a new platform supported. MacOS X appears to work mostly, thanks for the
patches from Pete Hunt.

Bug fixes
---------

- The use of a local variable name as an expression was not covered and lead to
  a compiler crash. Totally amazing, but true, nothing in the test suite of
  CPython covered this. `Issue#30 <http://bugs.nuitka.net/issue30>`__. Fixed in
  release 0.3.19.1 already.

- The use of a closure variable name as an expression was not covered as
  well. And in this case corrupted the reference count. `Issue#31
  <http://bugs.nuitka.net/issue31>`__. Fixed in release 0.3.19.1 already.

- The ``from x import *`` attempted to respect ``__all__`` but failed to do
  so. `Issue#32 <http://bugs.nuitka.net/issue32>`__. Fixed in release 0.3.19.2
  already.

- The ``from x import *`` didn't give a ``SyntaxError`` when used on
  Python3. Fixed in release 0.3.19.2 already.

- The syntax error messages for "global for function argument name" and
  "duplicate function argument name" are now identical as well.

- Parameter values of generator function could cause compilation errors when
  used in the closure of list contractions. Fixed.

New Features
------------

- Added support for disabling the console for Windows binaries. Thanks for the
  patch go to Michael H Kent.

- Enhanced Python3 support for syntax errors, these are now also compatible.

- Support for MacOS X was added.

- Support for using the clang compiler was added, it can be enforced via
  ``--clang`` option. Currently this option is mainly intended to allow testing
  the "MacOS X" support as good as possible under Linux.

New Optimization
----------------

- Enhanced all optimization that previously worked on "constants" to work on
  "compile time constants" instead. A "compile time constant" can currently also
  be any form of a built-in name or exception reference. It is intended to
  expand this in the future.

- Added support for built-ins ``bin``, ``oct``, and ``hex``, which also can be
  computed at compile time, if their arguments are compile time constant.

- Added support for the ``iter`` built-in in both forms, one and two
  arguments. These cannot be computed at compile time, but now will execute
  faster.

- Added support for the ``next`` built-in, also in its both forms, one and two
  arguments. These also cannot be computed at compile time, but now will execute
  faster as well.

- Added support for the ``open`` built-in in all its form. We intend for future
  releases to be able to track file opens for including them into the executable
  if data files.

- Optimize the ``__debug__`` built-in constant as well. It cannot be assigned,
  yet code can determine a mode of operation from it, and apparently some code
  does. When compiling the mode is decided.

- Optimize the ``Ellipsis`` built-in constant as well. It falls in the same
  category as ``True``, ``False``, ``None``, i.e. names of built-in constants
  that a singletons.

- Added support for anonymous built-in references, i.e. built-ins which have
  names that are not normally accessible. An example is ``type(None)`` which is
  not accessible from anywhere. Other examples of such names are
  ``compiled_method_or_function``.

  Having these as represented internally, and flagged as "compile time
  constants", allows the compiler to make more compile time optimization and to
  generate more efficient C++ code for it that won't e.g. call the ``type``
  built-in with ``None`` as an argument.

- All built-in names used in the program are now converted to "built-in name
  references" in a first step. Unsupported built-ins like e.g. ``zip``, for
  which Nuitka has no own code or understanding yet, remained as "module
  variables", which made access to them slow, and difficult to recognize.

- Added optimization for module attributes ``__file__``, ``__doc__`` and
  ``__package__`` if they are read only. It's the same as ``__name__``.

- Added optimization for slices and subscripts of "compile time constant"
  values. These will play a more important role, once value propagation makes
  them more frequent.

Organizational
--------------

- Created a "change log" from the previous release announcements. It's as
  ReStructured Text and converted to PDF for the release as well, but I chose
  not to include that in Debian, because it's so easy to generate the PDF on
  that yourself.

- The posting of release announcements is now prepared by a script that converts
  the ReStructured Text to HTML and adds it to Wordpress as a draft posting or
  updates it, until it's release time. Simple, sweet and elegant.

Cleanups
--------

- Split out the ``nuitka.nodes.Nodes`` module into many topic nodes, so that
  there are now ``nuitka.nodes.BoolNodes`` or ``nuitka.nodes.LoopNodes`` to host
  nodes of similar kinds, so that it is now cleaner.

- Split ``del`` statements into their own node kind, and use much simpler node
  structures for them. The following blocks are absolutely the same:

  .. code-block:: python

     del a, b.c, d

  .. code-block:: python

     del a
     del b.c
     del d

  So that's now represented in the node tree. And even more complex looking
  cases, like this one, also the same:

  .. code-block:: python

     del a, (b.c, d)

  This one gives a different parse tree, but the same bytecode. And so Nuitka
  need no longer concern itself with this at all, and can remove the tuple from
  the parse tree immediately. That makes them easy to handle. As you may have
  noted already, it also means, there is no way to enforce that two things are
  deleted or none at all.

- Turned the function and class builder statements into mere assignment
  statements, where defaults and base classes are handled by wrapping
  expressions.

  Previously they are also kind of assignment statements too, which is not
  needed. Now they were reduced to only handle the ``bases`` for classes and the
  ``defaults`` for functions and make optional.

- Refactored the decorator handling to the tree building stage, presenting them
  as function calls on "function body expression" or class body expression".

  This allowed to remove the special code for decorators from code generation
  and C++ templates, making decorations easy subjects for future optimization,
  as they practically are now just function calls.

  .. code-block:: python

     @some_classdecorator
     class C:
         @staticmethod
         def f():
             pass

  It's just a different form of writing things. Nothing requires the
  implementation of decorators, it's just functions calls with function bodies
  before the assignment.

  The following is only similar:

  .. code-block:: python

     class C:
         def f():
             pass

         f = staticmethod(f)

     C = some_classdecorator(C)

  It's only similar, because the assignment to an intermediate value of ``C``
  and ``f`` is not done, and if an exception was raised by the decoration, that
  name could persist. For Nuitka, the function and class body, before having a
  name, are an expression, and so can of course be passed to decorators already.

- The in-place assignments statements are now handled using temporary variable
  blocks

  Adding support for scoped temporary variables and references to them, it was
  possible to re-formulate in-place assignments expressions as normal look-ups,
  in-place operation call and then assignment statement. This allowed to remove
  static templates and will yield even better generated code in the future.

- The for loop used to have has a "source" expression as child, and the iterator
  over it was only taken at the code generation level, so that step was
  therefore invisible to optimization. Moved it to tree building stage instead,
  where optimization can work on it then.

- Tree building now generally allows statement sequences to be ``None``
  everywhere, and pass statements are immediately eliminated from them
  immediately. Empty statement sequences are now forbidden to exist.

- Moved the optimization for ``__name__`` to compute node of variable
  references, where it doesn't need anything complex to replace with the
  constant value if it's only read.

- Added new bases classes and mix-in classes dedicated to expressions, giving a
  place for some defaults.

- Made the built-in code more reusable.

New Tests
---------

- Added some more diagnostic tests about complex assignment and ``del``
  statements.

- Added syntax test for star import on function level, that must fail on
  Python3.

- Added syntax test for duplicate argument name.

- Added syntax test for global on a function argument name.

Summary
-------

The decorator and building changes, the assignment changes, and the node
cleanups are all very important progress for the type inference work, because
they remove special casing the that previously would have been required. Lambdas
and functions now really are the same thing right after tree building. The
in-place assignments are now merely done using standard assignment code, the
built functions and classes are now assigned to names in assignment statements,
much *more* consistency there.

Yet, even more work will be needed in the same direction. There may e.g. be work
required to cover ``with`` statements as well. And assignments will become no
more complex than unpacking from a temporary variable.

For this release, there is only minimal progress on the Python3 front, despite
the syntax support, which is only miniscule progress. The remaining tasks appear
all more or less difficult work that I don't want to touch now.

There are still remaining steps, but we can foresee that a release may be done
that finally actually does type inference and becomes the effective Python
compiler this project is all about.


Nuitka Release 0.3.19
=====================

This time there are a few bug fixes, major cleanups, more Python3 support, and
even new features. A lot things in this are justifying a new release.

Bug fixes
---------

- The man pages of ``nuitka`` and ``nuitka-python`` had no special layout for
  the option groups and broken whitespace for ``--recurse-to`` option. Also
  ``--g++-only`` was only partially bold. Released as 0.3.18.1 hot fix already.

- The command line length improvement we made to Scons for Windows was not
  portable to Python2.6. Released as 0.3.18.2 hot fix already.

- Code to detect already considered packages detection was not portable to
  Windows, for one case, there was still a use of ``/`` instead of using a
  ``joinpath`` call. Released as 0.3.18.3 already.

- A call to the range built-in with no arguments would crash the compiler, see
  `Issue#29 <http://bugs.nuitka.net/issue29>`__. Released as 0.3.18.4 already.

- Compatibility Fix: When rich comparison operators returned false value other
  ``False``, for comparison chains, these would not be used, but ``False``
  instead, see .

- The support for ``__import__`` didn't cover keyword arguments, these were
  simply ignored. See `Issue#28 <http://bugs.nuitka.net/issue28>`__. Fixed, but
  no warning is given yet.

New Features
------------

- A new option has been added, one can now specify ``--recurse-directory`` and
  Nuitka will attempt to embed these modules even if not obviously
  imported. This is not yet working perfect yet, but will receive future
  improvements.

- Added support for the ``exec`` built-in of Python3, this enables us to run one
  more basic test, ``GlobalStatement.py`` with Python3. The test ``ExecEval.py``
  nearly works now.

New Optimization
----------------

- The no arguments ``range()`` call now optimized into the static CPython
  exception it raises.

- Parts of comparison chains with constant arguments are now optimized away.

Cleanups
--------

- Simplified the ``CPythonExpressionComparison`` node, it now always has only 2
  operands.

  If there are more, the so called "comparison chain", it's done via ``and``
  with assignments to temporary variables, which are expressed by a new node
  type ``CPythonExpressionTempVariableRef``. This allowed to remove
  ``expression_temps`` from C++ code templates and generation, reducing the
  overall complexity.

- When executing a module (``--execute`` but not ``--exe``), no longer does
  Nuitka import it into itself, instead a new interpreter is launched with a
  fresh environment.

- The calls to the variadic ``MAKE_TUPLE`` were replaced with calls the
  ``MAKE_TUPLExx`` (where ``xx`` is the number of arguments), that are generated
  on a as-needed basis. This gives more readable code, because no
  ``EVAL_ORDERED_xx`` is needed at call site anymore.

- Many node classes have moved to new modules in ``nuitka.nodes`` and grouped by
  theme. That makes them more accessible.

- The choosing of the debug python has moved from Scons to Nuitka itself. That
  way it can respect the ``sys.abiflags`` and works with Python3.

- The replacing of ``.py`` in filenames was made more robust. No longer is
  ``str.replace`` used, but instead proper means to assure that having ``.py``
  as other parts of the filenames won't be a trouble.

- Module recursion was changed into its own module, instead of being hidden in
  the optimization that considers import statements.

- As always, some PyLint work, and some minor ``TODO`` were solved.

Organizational
--------------

- Added more information to the "`Developer Manual
  <http://nuitka.net/doc/developer-manual.html>`__", e.g. documenting the tree
  changes for ``assert`` to become a conditional statement with a raise
  statement, etc.

- The Debian package is as of this version verified to be installable and
  functional on to Ubuntu Natty, Maverick, Oneiric, and Precise.

- Added support to specify the binary under test with a ``NUITKA`` environment,
  so the test framework can run with installed version of Nuitka too.

- Made sure the test runners work under Windows as well. Required making them
  more portable. And a workaround for ``os.execl`` not propagating exit codes
  under Windows. See `Issue#26 <http://bugs.nuitka.net/issue26>`__ for more
  information.

- For windows target the MinGW library is now linked statically. That means
  there is no requirement for MinGW to be in the ``PATH`` or even installed to
  execute the binary.

New Tests
---------

- The ``basic``, ``programs``, ``syntax``, and ``reflected`` were made
  executable under Windows. Occasionally this meant to make the test runners
  more portable, or to work around limitations.

- Added test to cover return values of rich comparisons in comparison chains,
  and order of argument evaluation for comparison chains.

- The ``Referencing.py`` test was made portable to Python3.

- Cover no arguments ``range()`` exception as well.

- Added test to demonstrate that ``--recurse-directory`` actually works. This is
  using an ``__import__`` that cannot be predicted at run time (yet).

- The created source package is now tested on pbuilder chroots to be pass
  installation and the basic tests, in addition to the full tests during package
  build time on these chroots. This will make sure, that Nuitka works fine on
  Ubuntu Natty and doesn't break without notice.

Summary
-------

This releases contains many changes. The "temporary variable ref" and
"assignment expression" work is ground breaking. I foresee that it will lead to
even more simplifications of code generation in the future, when e.g. in-place
assignments can be reduced to assignments to temporary variables and conditional
statements.

While there were many improvements related to Windows support and fixing
portability bugs, or the Debian package, the real focus is the optimization
work, which will ultimately end with "value propagation" working.

These are the real focus. The old comparison chain handling was a big
wart. Working, but no way understood by any form of analysis in Nuitka. Now they
have a structure which makes their code generation based on semantics and allows
for future optimization to see through them.

Going down this route is an important preparatory step. And there will be more
work like this needed. Consider e.g. handling of in-place assignments. With an
"assignment expression" to a "temporary variable ref", these become the same as
user code using such a variable. There will be more of these to find.

So, that is where the focus is. The release now was mostly aiming at getting
involved fixes out. The bug fixed by comparison chain reworking, and the
``__import__`` related one, were not suitable for hot fix releases, so that is
why the 0.3.19 release had to occur now. But with plugin support, with this
comparison chain cleanup, with improved Python3 support, and so on, there was
plenty of good stuff already, also worth to get out.


Nuitka Release 0.3.18
=====================

This is to inform you about the new stable release of Nuitka. This time there
are a few bug fixes, and the important step that triggered the release: Nuitka
has entered Debian Unstable. So you if want, you will get stable Nuitka releases
from now on via ``apt-get install nuitka``.

The release cycle was too short to have much focus. It merely includes fixes,
which were available as hot fixes, and some additional optimization and node
tree cleanups, as well as source cleanups. But not much else.

Bug fixes
---------

- Conditional statements with both branches empty were not optimized away in all
  cases, triggering an assertion of code generation. `Issue#16
  <http://bugs.nuitka.net/issue16>`__. Released as 0.3.17a hot fix already.

- Nuitka was considering directories to contain packages that had no
  "__init__.py" which could lead to errors when it couldn't find the package
  later in the compilation process. Released as 0.3.17a hot fix already.

- When providing ``locals()`` to ``exec`` statements, this was not making the
  ``locals()`` writable. The logic to detect the case that default value is used
  (None) and be pessimistic about it, didn't consider the actual value
  ``locals()``. Released as 0.3.17b hot fix already.

- Compatibility Fix: When no defaults are given, CPython uses ``None`` for
  ``func.func_defaults``, but Nuitka had been using ``None``.

New Optimization
----------------

- If the condition of assert statements can be predicted, these are now
  optimized in a static raise or removed.

- For built-in name references, there is now dedicated code to look them up,
  that doesn't check the module level at all. Currently these are used in only a
  few cases though.

- Cleaner code is generated for the simple case of ``print`` statements. This is
  not only faster code, it's also more readable.

Cleanups
--------

- Removed the ``CPythonStatementAssert`` node.

  It's not needed, instead at tree building, assert statements are converted to
  conditional statements with the asserted condition result inverted and a raise
  statement with ``AssertionError`` and the assertion argument.

  This allowed to remove code and complexity from the subsequent steps of
  Nuitka, and enabled existing optimization to work on assert statements as
  well.

- Moved built-in exception names and built-in names to a new module
  ``nuitka.Builtins`` instead of having in other places. This was previously a
  bit spread-out and misplaced.

- Added cumulative ``tags`` to node classes for use in checks. Use it annotate
  which node kinds to visit in e.g. per scope finalization steps. That avoids
  kinds and class checks.

- New node for built-in name loopups, which allowed to remove tricks played with
  adding module variable lookups for ``staticmethod`` when adding them for
  ``__new__`` or module variable lookups for ``str`` when predicting the result
  of ``type('a')``, which was unlikely to cause a problem, but an important
  ``TODO`` item still.

Organizational
--------------

- The `"Download" <../pages/download.html>`__ page is now finally updated for
  releases automatically.

  This closes `Issue#7 <http://bugs.nuitka.net/issue7>`__ completely. Up to this
  release, I had to manually edit that page, but now mastered the art of
  upload via XMLRCP and a Python script, so that don't loose as much time with
  editing, checking it, etc.

- The Debian package is backportable to Ubuntu Natty, Maverick, Oneiric, I
  expect to make a separate announcement with links to packages.

- Made sure the test runners worth with bare ``python2.6`` as well.

New Tests
---------

- Added some tests intended for type inference development.

Summary
-------

This releases contains not as much changes as others, mostly because it's the
intended base for a Debian upload.

The ``exec`` fix was detected by continued work on the branch
``feature/minimize_CPython26_tests_diff`` branch, but that work is now complete.

It is being made pretty (many git rebase iterations) with lots of Issues being
added to the bug tracker and referenced for each change. The intention is to
have a clean commits repository with the changed made.

But of course, the real excitement is the "type inference" work. It will give a
huge boost to Nuitka. With this in place, new benchmarks may make sense. I am
working on getting it off the ground, but also to make us more efficient.

So when I learn something. e.g. ``assert`` is not special, I apply it to the
``develop`` branch immediately, to keep the differences as small as possible,
and to immediately benefit from such improvements.


Nuitka Release 0.3.17
=====================

This is to inform you about the new stable release of Nuitka. This time there
are a few bug fixes, lots of very important organisational work, and yet again
improved compatibility and cleanups. Also huge is the advance in making
``--deep`` go away and making the recursion of Nuitka controllable, which means
a lot for scalability of projects that use a lot of packages that use other
packages, because now you can choose which ones to embed and which ones one.

The release cycle had a focus on improving the quality of the test scripts, the
packaging, and generally to prepare the work on "type inference" in a new
feature branch.

I have also continued to work towards CPython3.2 compatibility, and this
version, while not there, supports Python3 with a large subset of the basic
tests programs running fine (of course via ``2to3`` conversion) without
trouble. There is still work to do, exceptions don't seem to work fully yet,
parameter parsing seems to have changed, etc. but it seems that CPython3.2 is
going to work one day.

And there has been a lot of effort, to address the Debian packaging to be
cleaner and more complete, addressing issues that prevented it from entering the
Debian repository.

Bug fixes
---------

- Fixed the handling of modules and packages of the same name, but with
  different casing. Problem showed under Windows only. Released as 0.3.16a
  hot fix already.

- Fixed an error where the command line length of Windows was exceeded when many
  modules were embedded, Christopher Tott provided a fix for it. Released as
  0.3.16a hot fix already.

- Fix, avoid to introduce new variables for where built-in exception references
  are sufficient. Released as 0.3.16b hot fix already.

- Fix, add the missing ``staticmethod`` decorator to ``__new__`` methods before
  resolving the scopes of variables, this avoids the use of that variable before
  it was assigned a scope. Released as 0.3.16b hot fix already.

New Features
------------

- Enhanced compatibility again, provide enough ``co_varnames`` in the code
  objects, so that slicing them up to ``code_object.co_argcount`` will
  work. They are needed by ``inspect`` module and might be used by some
  decorators as well.

- New options to control the recursion:

  ``--recurse-none`` (do not warn about not-done recursions)
  ``--recurse-all`` (recurse to all otherwise warned modules)
  ``--recurse-to`` (confirm to recurse to those modules)
  ``--recurse-not-to`` (confirm to not recurse to those modules)

New Optimization
----------------

- The optimization of constant conditional expressions was not done yet. Added
  this missing constant propagation case.

- Eliminate near empty statement sequences (only contain a pass statement) in
  more places, giving a cleaner node structure for many constructs.

- Use the pickle "protocol 2" on CPython2 except for ``unicode`` strings where
  it does not work well. It gives a more compressed and binary representation,
  that is generally more efficient to un-stream as well. Also use the cPickle
  protocol, the use of ``pickle`` was not really necessary anymore.

Organizational
--------------

- Added a "`Developer Manual <http://nuitka.net/doc/developer-manual.html>`__"
  to the release. It's incomplete, but it details some of the existing stuff,
  coding rules, plans for "type inference", etc.

- Improved the ``--help`` output to use ``metavar`` where applicable. This makes
  it more readable for some options.

- Instead of error message, give help output when no module or program file name
  was given. This makes Nuitka help out more convenient.

- Consistently use ``#!/usr/bin/env python`` for all scripts, this was
  previously only done for some of them.

- Ported the PyLint check script to Python as well, enhancing it on the way to
  check the exit code, and to only output changes things, as well as making the
  output of warnings for ``TODO`` items optional.

- All scripts used for testing, PyLint checking, etc. now work with Python3 as
  well. Most useful on Arch Linux, where it's also already the default for
  ``Python``.

- The help output of Nuitka was polished a lot more. It is now more readable and
  uses option groups to combine related options together.

- Make the tests run without any dependence on ``PATH`` to contain the
  executables of Nuitka. This makes it easier to use.

- Add license texts to 3rd party file that were missing them, apply
  ``licensecheck`` results to cleanup Nuitka. Also removed own copyright
  statement from in-line copy of Scons, it had been added by accident only.

- Release the tests that I own as well as the Debian packaging I created under
  "Apache License 2.0" which is very liberal, meaning every project will be able
  to use it.

- Don't require copyright assignment for contributions anymore, instead only
  "Apache License 2.0", the future Nuitka license, so that the code won't be a
  problem when changing the license of all of Nuitka to that license.

- Give contributors listed in the "`User Manual
  <http://nuitka.net/doc/user-manual.html>`__" an exception to the GPL terms
  until Nuitka is licensed under "Apache License 2.0" as well.

- Added an ``--experimental`` option which can be used to control experimental
  features, like the one currently being added on ``feature/ctypes_annotation``,
  where "type inference" is currently only activated when that option is
  given. For this stable release, it does nothing.

- Check the static C++ files of Nuitka with ``cppcheck`` as well. Didn't find
  anything.

- Arch Linux packages have been contributed, these are linked for download, but
  the stable package may lag behind a bit.

Cleanups
--------

- Changed ``not`` boolean operation to become a normal operator. Changed ``and``
  and ``or`` boolean operators to a new base class, and making their interface
  more similar to that of operations.

- Added cumulative ``tags`` to node classes for use in checks. Use it annotate
  which node kinds to visit in e.g. per scope finalization steps. That avoids
  kinds and class checks.

- Enhanced the "visitor" interface to provide more kinds of callbacks, enhanced
  the way "each scope" visiting is achieved by generalizing is as "child has not
  tag 'closure_taker'" and that for every "node that has tag 'closure_taker'".

- Moved ``SyntaxHighlighting`` module to ``nuitka.gui`` package where it
  belongs.

- More white listing work for imports. As recursion is now the default, and
  leads to warnings for non-existent modules, the CPython tests gave a lot of
  good candidates for import errors that were white listed.

- Consistently use ``nuitka`` in test scripts, as there isn't a ``Nuitka.py`` on
  all platforms. The later is scheduled for removal.

- Some more PyLint cleanups.

New Tests
---------

- Make sure the basic tests pass with CPython or else fail the test. This is to
  prevent false positives, where a test passes, but only because it fails in
  CPython early on and then does so with Nuitka too. For the syntax tests we
  make sure they fail.

- The basic tests can now be run with ``PYTHON=python3.2`` and use ``2to3``
  conversion in that case. Also the currently not passing tests are not run, so
  the passing tests continue to do so, with this run from the release test
  script ``check-release``.

- Include the syntax tests in release tests as well.

- Changed many existing tests so that they can run under CPython3 too. Of course
  this is via ``2to3`` conversion.

- Don't fail if the CPython test suites are not there.

  Currently they remain largely unpublished, and as such are mostly only
  available to me (exception, ``feature/minimize_CPython26_tests_diff`` branch
  references the CPython2.6 tests repository, but that remains work in
  progress).

- For the compile itself test: Make the presence of the Scons in-line copy
  optional, the Debian package doesn't contain it.

- Also make it more portable, so it runs under Windows too, and allow to choose
  the Python version to test. Check this test with both CPython2.6 and
  CPython2.7 not only the default Python.

- Before releasing, test that the created Debian package builds fine in a
  minimal Debian ``unstable`` chroot, and passes all the tests included in the
  package (``basics``, ``syntax``, ``programs``, ``reflected``). Also many other
  Debian packaging improvements.

Summary
-------

The "git flow" was used again in this release cycle and proved to be useful not
only for hot fix, but also for creating the branch ``feature/ctypes_annotation``
and rebasing it often while things are still flowing.

The few hot fixes didn't require a new release, but the many organizational
improvements and the new features did warrant the new release, because of
e.g. the much better test handling in this release and the improved recursion
control.

The work on Python3 support has slowed down a bit. I mostly only added some bits
for compatibility, but generally it has slowed down. I wanted to make sure it
doesn't regress by accident, so running with CPython3.2 is now part of the
normal release tests.

What's still missing is more "hg" completeness. Only the ``co_varnames`` work
for ``inspect`` was going in that direction, and this has slowed down. It was
more important to make Nuitka's recursion more accessible with the new options,
so that was done first.

And of course, the real excitement is the "type inference" work. It will give a
huge boost to Nuitka, and I am happy that it seems to go well. With this in
place, new benchmarks may make sense. I am working on getting it off the ground,
so other people can work on it too. My idea of ``ctypes`` native calls may
become true sooner than expected. To support that, I would like to add more
tools to make sure we discover changes earlier on, checking the XML
representations of tests to discover improvements and regressions more clearly.


Nuitka Release 0.3.16
=====================

This time there are many bug fixes, some important scalability work, and again
improved compatibility and cleanups.

The release cycle had a focus on fixing the bug reports I received. I have also
continued to look at CPython3 compatibility, and this is the first version to
support Python3 somewhat, at least some of the basic tests programs run (of
course via ``2to3`` conversion) without trouble. I don't know when, but it seems
that it's going to work one day.

Also there has an effort to make the Debian packaging cleaner, addressing all
kinds of small issues that prevented it from entering the Debian
repository. It's still not there, but it's making progress.

Bug fixes
---------

- Fixed a packaging problem for Linux and x64 platform, the new ``swapFiber.S``
  file for the fiber management was not included. Released as 0.3.15a hot fix
  already.

- Fixed an error where optimization was performed on removed unreachable code,
  which lead to an error. Released as 0.3.15b hot fix already.

- Fixed an issue with ``__import__`` and recursion not happening in any case,
  because when it did, it failed due to not being ported to new internal
  APIs. Released as 0.3.15c hot fix already.

- Fixed ``eval()`` and ``locals()`` to be supported in generator expressions and
  contractions too. Released as 0.3.15d hot fix already.

- Fixed the Windows batch files ``nuitka.bat`` and ``nuitka-python.bat`` to not
  output the ``rem`` statements with the copyright header. Released as 0.3.15d
  hot fix already.

- Fixed re-raise with ``raise``, but without a current exception set. Released
  as 0.3.15e hot fix already.

- Fixed ``vars()`` call on the module level, needs to be treated as
  ``globals()``. Released as 0.3.15e hot fix already.

- Fix handling of broken new lines in source files. Read the source code in
  "universal line ending mode". Released as 0.3.15f hot fix already.

- Fixed handling of constant module attribute ``__name__`` being replaced. Don't
  replace local variables of the same name too. Released as 0.3.15g hot fix
  already.

- Fixed assigning to ``True``, ``False`` or ``None``. There was this old
  ``TODO``, and some code has compatibility craft that does it. Released as
  0.3.15g hot fix already.

- Fix constant dictionaries not always being recognized as shared. Released as
  0.3.15g hot fix already.

- Fix generator function objects to not require a return frame to exist. In
  finalize cleanup it may not.

- Fixed non-execution of cleanup codes that e.g. flush ``sys.stdout``, by adding
  ``Py_Finalize()``.

- Fix ``throw()`` method of generator expression objects to not check arguments
  properly.

- Fix missing fallback to subscript operations for slicing with non-indexable
  objects.

- Fix, in-place subscript operations could fail to apply the update, if the
  intermediate object was e.g. a list and the handle just not changed by the
  operation, but e.g. the length did.

- Fix, the future spec was not properly preserving the future division flag.

New Optimization
----------------

- The optimization scales now much better, because per-module optimization only
  require the module to be reconsidered, but not all modules all the time. With
  many modules recursed into, this makes a huge difference in compilation time.

- The creation of dictionaries from constants is now also optimized.

New Features
------------

- As a new feature functions now have the ``func_defaults`` and ``__defaults__``
  attribute. It works only well for non-nested parameters and is not yet fully
  integrated into the parameter parsing. This improves the compatibility
  somewhat already though.

- The names ``True``, ``False`` and ``None`` are now converted to constants only
  when they are read-only module variables.

- The ``PYTHONPATH`` variable is now cleared when immediately executing a
  compiled binary unless ``--execute-with-pythonpath`` is given, in which case
  it is preserved. This allows to make sure that a binary is in fact containing
  everything required.

Organizational
--------------

- The help output of Nuitka was polished a lot more. It is now more readable and
  uses option groups to combine related options together.

- The in-line copy of Scons is not checked with PyLint anymore. We of course
  don't care.

- Program tests are no longer executed in the program directory, so failed
  module inclusions become immediately obvious.

- The basic tests can now be run with ``PYTHON=python3.2`` and use ``2to3``
  conversion in that case.

Cleanups
--------

- Moved ``tags`` to a separate module, make optimization emit only documented
  tags, checked against the list of allowed ones.

- The Debian package has seen lots of improvements, to make it "lintian clean",
  even in pedantic mode. The homepage of Nuitka is listed, a watch file can
  check for new releases, the git repository and the gitweb are referenced, etc.

- Use ``os.path.join`` in more of the test code to achieve more Windows
  portability for them.

- Some more PyLint cleanups.

New Tests
---------

- There is now a ``Crasher`` test, for tests that crashed Nuitka previously.

- Added a program test where the imported module does a ``sys.exit()`` and make
  sure it really doesn't continue after the ``SystemExit`` exception that
  creates.

- Cover the type of ``__builtins__`` in the main program and in imported modules
  in tests too. It's funny and differs between module and dict in CPython2.

- Cover a final ``print`` statement without newline in the test. Must still
  receive a newline, which only happens when ``Py_Finalize()`` is called.

- Added test with functions that makes a ``raise`` without an exception set.

- Cover the calling of ``vars()`` on module level too.

- Cover the use of eval in contractions and generator expressions too.

- Cover ``func_defaults`` and ``__default__`` attributes for a function too.

- Added test function with two ``raise`` in an exception handler, so that one
  becomes dead code and removed without the crash.

Summary
-------

The "git flow" was really great in this release cycle. There were many hot fix
releases being made, so that the bugs could be addressed immediately without
requiring the overhead of a full release. I believe that this makes Nuitka
clearly one of the best supported projects.

This quick turn-around also encourages people to report more bugs, which is only
good. And the structure is there to hold it. Of course, the many bug fixes meant
that there is not as much new development, but that is not the priority,
correctness is.

The work on Python3 is a bit strange. I don't need Python3 at all. I also
believe it is that evil project to remove cruft from the Python core and make
developers of all relevant Python software, add compatibility cruft to their
software instead. Yet, I can't really stop to work on it. It has that appeal of
small fixups here and there, and then something else works too.

Python3 work is like when I was first struggling with Nuitka to pass the
CPython2 unit tests for a first time. It's fun. And then it finds real actual
bugs that apply to CPython2 too. Not doing ``Py_Finalize`` (but having to), the
slice operations shortcomings, the bug of subscript in-place, and so on. There
is likely more things hidden, and the earlier Python3 is supported, the more
benefit from increased test covered.

What's missing is more "hg" completeness. I think only the ``raise`` without
exception set and the ``func_defaults`` issue were going into its direction, but
it won't be enough yet.


Nuitka Release 0.3.15
=====================

This is to inform you about the new stable release of Nuitka. This time again
many organizational improvements, some bug fixes, much improved compatibility
and cleanups.

This release cycle had a focus on packaging Nuitka for easier consumption,
i.e. automatic packaging, making automatic uploads, improvement documentation,
and generally cleaning things up, so that Nuitka becomes more compatible and
ultimately capable to run the "hg" test suite. It's not there yet, but this is a
huge jump for usability of Nuitka and its compatibility, again.

Then lots of changes that make Nuitka approach Python3 support, the generated
C++ for at least one large example is compiling with this new release. It won't
link, but there will be later releases.

And there is a lot of cleanup going on, geared towards compatibility with line
numbers in the frame object.

Bug fixes
---------

- The main module was using ``__main__`` in tracebacks, but it must be
  ``<module>``. Released as 0.3.14a hot fix already.

- Workaround for "execfile cannot be used as an expression". It wasn't possible
  to use ``execfile`` in an expression, only as a statement.

  But then there is crazy enough code in e.g. mercurial that uses it in a lambda
  function, which made the issue more prominent. The fix now allows it to be an
  expression, except on the class level, which wasn't seen yet.

- The in-line copy of Scons was not complete enough to work for "Windows" or
  with ``--windows-target`` for cross compile. Fixed.

- Cached frames didn't release the "back" frame, therefore holding variables of
  these longer than CPython does, which could cause ordering problems. Fixed for
  increased compatibility.

- Handle "yield outside of function" syntax error in compiled source
  correctly. This one was giving a Nuitka backtrace, now it gives a
  ``SyntaxError`` as it needs to.

- Made syntax/indentation error output absolutely identical to CPython.

- Using the frame objects ``f_lineno`` may fix endless amounts bugs related to
  traceback line numbers.

New Features
------------

- Guesses the location of the MinGW compiler under Windows to default install
  location, so it need not be added to ``PATH`` environment variable. Removes
  the need to modify ``PATH`` environment just for Nuitka to find it.

- Added support for "lambda generators". You don't want to know what it is. Lets
  just say, it was the last absurd language feature out there, plus that didn't
  work. It now works perfect.

Organizational
--------------

- You can now download a Windows installer and a Debian package that works on
  Debian Testing, current Ubuntu and Mint Linux.

- New release scripts give us the ability to have hot fix releases as download
  packages immediately. That means the "git flow" makes even more beneficial to
  the users.

- Including the generated "README.pdf" in the distribution archives, so it can
  be read instead of "README.txt". The text file is fairly readable, due to the
  use of ReStructured Text, but the PDF is even nicer to read, due to
  e.g. syntax highlighting of the examples.

- Renamed the main binaries to ``nuitka`` and ``nuitka-python``, so that there
  is no dependency on case sensitive file systems.

- For Windows there are batch files ``nuitka.bat`` and ``nuitka-python.bat`` to
  make Nuitka directly executable without finding the ``Python.exe``, which the
  batch files can tell from their own location.

- There are now man pages of ``nuitka`` and ``nuitka-python`` with examples for
  the most common use cases. They are of course included in the Debian package.

- Don't strip the binary when executing it to analyse compiled binary with
  ``valgrind``. It will give better information that way, without changing the
  code.

New Optimization
----------------

- Implemented ``swapcontext`` alike (``swapFiber``) for x64 to achieve 8 times
  speedup for Generators. It doesn't do useless syscalls to preserve signal
  masks. Now Nuitka is faster at frame switching than CPython on x64, which is
  already good by design.

Cleanups
--------

- Using the frame objects to store current line of execution avoids the need to
  store it away in helper code at all. It ought to also help a lot with
  threading support, and makes Nuitka even more compatible, because now line
  numbers will be correct even outside tracebacks, but for mere stack frame
  dumps.

- Moved the ``for_return`` detection from code generation to tree building where
  it belongs. Yield statements used as return statements need slightly different
  code for Python2.6 difference. That solved an old ``TODO``.

- Much Python3 portability work. Sometimes even improving existing code, the
  Python compiler code had picked up a few points, where the latest Nuitka
  didn't work with Python3 anymore, when put to actual compile.

  The test covered only syntax, but e.g. meta classes need different code in
  CPython3, and that's now supported. Also helper code was made portable in more
  places, but not yet fully. This will need more work.

- Cleaned up uses of debug defines, so they are now more consistent and in one
  place.

- Some more PyLint cleanups.

New Tests
---------

- The tests are now executed by Python scripts and cover ``stderr`` output
  too. Before we only checked ``stdout``. This unveiled a bunch of issues Nuitka
  had, but went unnoticed so far, and triggered e.g. the frame line number
  improvements.

- Separate syntax tests.

- The scripts to run the tests now are all in pure Python. This means, no more
  MinGW shell is needed to execute the tests.

Summary
-------

The Debian package, Windows installer, etc. are now automatically updated and
uploaded. From here on, there can be such packages for the hot fix releases too.

The exception tracebacks are now correct by design, and better covered.

The generator performance work showed that the approach taken by Nuitka is in
fact fast. It was fast on ARM already, but it's nice to see that it's now also
fast on x64. Programs using generators will be affected a lot by this.

Overall, this release brings Nuitka closer to usability. Better binary names,
man pages, improved documentation, issue tracker, etc. all there now. I am in
fact now looking for a sponsor for the Debian package to upload it into Debian
directly.

.. admonition:: Update

   The upload to Debian happened for 0.3.18 and was done by Yaroslav Halchenko.

What's missing is more "hg" completeness. The frame release issue helped it, but
``inspect.getargs()`` doesn't work yet, and is a topic for a future
release. Won't be easy, as ``func_defaults`` will be an invasive change too.


Nuitka Release 0.3.14
=====================

This is to inform you about the new stable release of Nuitka. This time it
contains mostly organisational improvements, some bug fixes, improved
compatibility and cleanups.

It is again the result of working towards compilation of a real program
(Mercurial). This time, I have added support for proper handling of compiled
types by the ``inspect`` module.

Bug fixes
---------

- Fix for "Missing checks in parameter parsing with star list, star dict and
  positional arguments". There was whole in the checks for argument counts, now
  the correct error is given. Fixed in 0.3.13a already.

- The simple slice operations with 2 values, not extended with 3 values, were
  not applying the correct order for evaluation. Fixed in 0.3.13a already.

- The simple slice operations couldn't handle ``None`` as the value for lower or
  upper index. Fixed in 0.3.11a already.

- The in-place simple slice operations evaluated the slice index expressions
  twice, which could cause problems if they had side effects. Fixed in 0.3.11a
  already.

New Features
------------

- Run time patching the ``inspect`` module so it accepts compiled functions,
  compiled methods, and compiled generator objects. The ``test_inspect`` test of
  CPython is nearly working unchanged with this.

- The generator functions didn't have ``CO_GENERATOR`` set in their code object,
  setting it made compatible with CPython in this regard too. The inspect module
  will therefore return correct value for ``inspect.isgeneratorfunction()`` too.

New Optimization
----------------

- Slice indexes that are ``None`` are now constant propagated as well.

- Slightly more efficient code generation for dual star arg functions, removing
  useless checks.

Cleanups
--------

- Moved the Scons, static C++ files, and assembler files to new package
  ``nuitka.build`` where also now ``SconsInterface`` module lives.

- Moved the Qt dialog files to ``nuitka.gui``

- Moved the "unfreezer" code to its own static C++ file.

- Some PyLint cleanups.

New Tests
---------

- New test ``Recursion`` to cover recursive functions.

- New test ``Inspection`` to cover the patching of ``inspect`` module.

- Cover ``execfile`` on the class level as well in ``ExecEval`` test.

- Cover evaluation order of simple slices in ``OrderCheck`` too.

Organizational
--------------

- There is a new issue tracker available under http://bugs.nuitka.net

  Please register and report issues you encounter with Nuitka. I have put all
  the known issues there and started to use it recently. It's Roundup based like
  http://bugs.python.org is, so people will find it familiar.

- The ``setup.py`` is now apparently functional. The source releases for
  download are made it with, and it appears the binary distributions work
  too. We may now build a windows installer. It's currently in testing, we will
  make it available when finished.

Summary
-------

The new source organisation makes packaging Nuitka really easy now. From here,
we can likely provide "binary" package of Nuitka soon. A windows installer will
be nice.

The patching of ``inspect`` works wonders for compatibility for those programs
that insist on checking types, instead of doing duck typing. The function call
problem, was an issue found by the Mercurial test suite.

For the "hg.exe" to pass all of its test suite, more work may be needed, this is
the overall goal I am currently striving for. Once real world programs like
Mercurial work, we can use these as more meaningful benchmarks and resume work
on optimization.


Nuitka Release 0.3.13
=====================

This release is mostly the result of working towards compilation of a real
programs (Mercurial) and to merge and finalize the frame stack work. Now Nuitka
has a correct frame stack at all times, and supports ``func_code`` and
``gi_code`` objects, something previously thought to be impossible.

Actually now it's only the "bytecode" objects that won't be there. And not
attributes of ``func_code`` are meaningful yet, but in theory can be supported.

Due to the use of the "git flow" for Nuitka, most of the bugs listed here were
already fixed in on the stable release before this release. This time there were
5 such hot fix releases, sometimes fixing multiple bugs.

Bug fixes
---------

- In case of syntax errors in the main program, an exception stack was giving
  that included Nuitka code. Changed to make the same output as CPython
  does. Fixed in 0.3.12a already.

- The star import (``from x import *``) didn't work for submodules. Providing
  ``*`` as the import list to the respective code allowed to drop the complex
  lookups we were doing before, and to simply trust CPython C/API to do it
  correctly. Fixed in 0.3.12 already.

- The absolute import is *not* the default of CPython 2.7 it seems. A local
  ``posix`` package shadows the standard library one. Fixed in 0.3.12 already.

- In ``--deep`` mode, a module may contain a syntax error. This is e.g. true of
  "PyQt" with ``port_v3`` included. These files contain Python3 syntax and fail
  to be imported in Python2, but that is not to be considered an error. These
  modules are now skipped with a warning. Fixed in 0.3.12b already.

- The code to import modules wasn't using the ``__import__`` built-in, which
  prevented ``__import__`` overriding code to work. Changed import to use the
  built-in. Fixed in 0.3.12c already.

- The code generated for the ``__import__`` built-in with constant values was
  doing relative imports only. It needs to attempt relative and absolut
  imports. Fixed in 0.3.12c already.

- The code of packages in "__init__.py" believed it was outside of the package,
  giving problems for package local imports. Fixed in 0.3.12d already.

- It appears that "Scons", which Nuitka uses internally and transparent to you,
  to execute the compilation and linking tasks, was sometimes not building the
  binaries or shared libraries, due to a false caching. As a workaround, these
  are now erased before doing the build. Fixed in 0.3.12d already.

- The use of ``in`` and ``not in`` in comparison chains (e.g. ``a < b < c`` is
  one), wasn't supported yet. The use of these in comparison chains ``a in b in
  c`` is very strange.

  Only in the ``test_grammar.py`` it was ever used I believe. Anyway, it's
  supported now, solving this ``TODO`` and reducing the difference. Fixed in
  0.3.12e already.

- The order of evaluation for ``in`` and ``not in`` operators wasn't enforced in
  a portable way. Now it is correct on "ARM" too. Fixed in 0.3.12e already.

New Optimization
----------------

- The built-ins ``GeneratorExit`` and ``StopIteration`` are optimized to their
  Python C/API names where possible as well.

Cleanups
--------

- The ``__file__`` attribute of modules was the relative filename, but for
  absolute filenames these become a horrible mess at least on Linux.

- Added assertion helpers for sane frame and code objects and use them.

- Make use of ``assertObject`` in more places.

- Instead of using ``os.path.sep`` all over, added a helper ``Utils.joinpath``
  that hides this and using ``os.path.join``. This gives more readable code.

- Added traces to the "unfreezer" guarded by a define. Helpful in analyzing
  import problems.

- Some PyLint cleanups removing dead code, unused variables, useless pass
  statement, etc.

New Tests
---------

- New tests to cover ``SyntaxError`` and ``IndentationError`` from ``--deep``
  imports and in main program.

- New test to cover evaluation order of ``in`` and ``not in`` comparisons.

- New test to cover package local imports made by the "__init__.py" of the
  package.

Organizational
--------------

- Drop "compile_itself.sh" in favor of the new "compile_itself.py", because the
  later is more portable.

- The logging output is now nicer, and for failed recursions, outputs the line
  that is having the problem.

Summary
-------

The frame stack work and the ``func_code`` are big for compatibility.

The ``func_code`` was also needed for "hg" to work. For Mercurial to pass all of
its test suite, more work will be needed, esp. the ``inspect`` module needs to
be run-time patched to accept compiled functions and generators too.

Once real world programs like Mercurial work, we can use these as more
meaningful benchmarks and resume work on optimization.


Nuitka Release 0.3.12
=====================

This is to inform you about the new release of Nuitka many bug fixes, and
substantial improvements especially in the organizational area. There is a new
"`User Manual <http://nuitka.net/doc/user-manual.html>`__" (`PDF
<http://nuitka.net/doc/user-manual.pdf>`__), with much improved content, a
``sys.meta_path`` based import mechanism for ``--deep`` mode, git flow goodness.

This release is generally also the result of working towards compilation of a
real programs (Mercurial) and to get things work more nicely on Windows by
default. Thanks go to Liu Zhenhai for helping me with this goal.

Due to the use of the "git flow", most of the bugs listed here were already
fixed in on the stable release before this release. And there were many of
these.

Bug fixes
---------

- The order of evaluation for base classes and class dictionaries was not
  enforced.

  Apparently nothing in the CPython test suite did that, I only noticed during
  debugging that Nuitka gave a different error than CPython did, for a class
  that had an undefined base class, because both class body and base classes
  were giving an error. Fixed in 0.3.11a already.

- Method objects didn't hold a reference to the used class.

  The effect was only noticed when ``--python-debug`` was used, i.e. the debug
  version of Python linked, because then the garbage collector makes
  searches. Fixed in 0.3.11b already.

- Set ``sys.executable`` on Linux as well. On Debian it is otherwise
  ``/usr/bin/python`` which might be a different version of Python
  entirely. Fixed in 0.3.11c already.

- Embedded modules inside a package could hide package variables of the same
  name. Learned during PyCON DE about this corner case. Fixed in 0.3.11d
  already.

- Packages could be duplicated internally. This had no effect on generated code
  other than appearing twice in the list if frozen modules. Fixed in 0.3.11d
  already.

- When embedding modules from outside current directory, the look-up failed. The
  embedding only ever worked for the compile itself and programs test cases,
  because they are all in the current directory then. Fixed in 0.3.11e already.

- The check for ARM target broke Windows support in the Scons file. Fixed in
  0.3.11f already.

- The star import from external modules failed with an error in ``--deep``
  mode. Fixed in 0.3.11g already.

- Modules with a parent package could cause a problem under some
  circumstances. Fixed in 0.3.11h already.

- One call variant, with both list and dict star arguments and keyword
  arguments, but no positional parameters, didn't have the required C++ helper
  function implemented. Fixed in 0.3.11h already.

- The detection of the CPU core count was broken on my hexacore at least. Gave
  36 instead of 6, which is a problem for large programs. Fixed in 0.3.11h
  already.

- The in-line copy of Scons didn't really work on Windows, which was sad,
  because we added it to simplify installation on Windows precisely because of
  this.

- Cleaning up the build directory from old sources and object files wasn't
  portable to Windows and therefore wasn't effective there.

- From imports where part of the imported were found modules and parts were not,
  didn't work. Solved by the feature branch ``meta_path_import`` that was merged
  for this release.

- Newer MinGW gave warnings about the default visibility not being possible to
  apply to class members. Fixed by not setting this default visibility anymore
  on Windows.

- The ``sys.executable`` gave warnings on Windows because of backslashes in the
  path. Using a raw string to prevent such problems.

- The standard library path was hard coded. Changed to run time detection.

Cleanups
--------

- Version checks on Python runtime now use a new define ``PYTHON_VERSION`` that
  makes it easier. I don't like ``PY_VERSION_HEX``, because it is so
  unreadable. Makes some of the checks a lot more safe.

- The ``sys.meta_path`` based import from the ``meta_path_import`` feature
  branch allowed the cleanup the way importing is done. It's a lot less code
  now.

- Removed some unused code. We will aim at making Nuitka the tool to detect dead
  code really.

- Moved ``nuitka.Nodes`` to ``nuitka.nodes.Nodes``, that is what the package is
  intended for, the split will come later.

New Tests
---------

- New tests for import variants that previously didn't work: Mixed
  imports. Imports from a package one level up. Modules hidden by a package
  variable, etc.

- Added test of function call variant that had no test previously. Only found it
  when compiling "hg". Amazing how nothing in my tests, CPython tests, etc. used
  it.

- Added test to cover the partial success of import statements.

- Added test to cover evaluation order of class definitions.

Organizational
--------------

- Migrated the "README.txt" from org-mode to ReStructured Text, which allows for
  a more readable document, and to generate a nice "`User Manual
  <http://nuitka.net/doc/user-manual.html>`__" in PDF form.

- The amount of information in "README.txt" was increased, with many more
  subjects are now covered, e.g. "git flow" and how to join Nuitka
  development. It's also impressive to see what code blocks and syntax
  highlighting can do for readability.

- The Nuitka git repository has seen multiple hot fixes.

  These allowed to publish bug fixes immediately after they were made, and
  avoided the need for a new release just to get these out. This really saves me
  a lot of time too, because I can postpone releasing the new version until it
  makes sense because of other things.

- Then there was a feature branch ``meta_path_import`` that lived until being
  merged to ``develop`` to improve the import code, which is now released on
  ``master`` as stable. Getting that feature right took a while.

- And there is the feature branch ``minimize_CPython26_tests_diff`` which has
  some success already in documenting the required changes to the "CPython26"
  test suite and in reducing the amount of differences, while doing it. We have
  a frame stack working there, albeit in too ugly code form.

- The release archives are now built using ``setuptools``. You can now also
  download a zip file, which is probably more Windows friendly. The intention is
  to work on that to make ``setup.py`` produce a Nuitka install that won't rely
  on any environment variables at all. Right now ``setup.py`` won't even allow
  any other options than ``sdist`` to be given.

- Ported "compile_itself.sh" to "compile_itself.py", i.e. ported it to
  Python. This way, we can execute it easily on Windows too, where it currently
  still fails. Replacing ``diff``, ``rm -rf``, etc. is a challenge, but it
  reduces the dependency on MSYS tools on Windows.

- The compilation of standard library is disabled by default, but ``site`` or
  ``dist`` packages are now embedded. To include even standard library, there is
  a ``--really-deep`` option that has to be given in addition to ``--deep``,
  which forces this.

Summary
-------

Again, huge progress. The improved import mechanism is very beautiful. It
appears that little is missing to compile real world programs like "hg" with
Nuitka. The next release cycle will focus on that and continue to improve the
Windows support which appears to have some issues.


Nuitka Release 0.3.11
=====================

This is to inform you about the new release of Nuitka with some bug fixes and
portability work.

This release is generally cleaning up things, and makes Nuitka portable to ARM
Linux. I used to host the Nuitka homepage on that machine, but now that it's no
longer so, I can run heavy compile jobs on it. To my surprise, it found many
portability problems. So I chose to fix that first, the result being that Nuitka
now works on ARM Linux too.

Bug fixes
---------

- The order of slice expressions was not correct on x86 as well, and I found
  that with new tests only. So the porting to ARM revealed a bug category, I
  previously didn't consider.

- The use of ``linux2`` in the Scons file is potentially incompatible with Linux
  3.0, although it seems that at least on Debian the ``sys.platform`` was
  changed back to ``linux2``. Anyway, it's probably best to allow just anything
  that starts with ``linux`` these days.

- The ``print`` statement worked like a ``print`` function, i.e. it first
  evaluated all printed expressions, and did the output only then. That is
  incompatible in case of exceptions, where partial outputs need to be done, and
  so that got fixed.

New Optimization
----------------

- Function calls now each have a dedicated helper function, avoiding in some
  cases unnecessary work. We will may build further on this and in-line
  ``PyObject_Call`` differently for the special cases.

Cleanups
--------

- Moved many C++ helper declarations and in-line implementations to dedicated
  header files for better organisation.

- Some dependencies were removed and consolidated to make the dependency graph
  sane.

- Multiple decorators were in reverse order in the node tree. The code
  generation reversed it back, so no bug, yet that was a distorted tree.

  Finding this came from the ARM work, because the "reversal" was in fact just
  the argument evaluation order of C++ under x86/x64, but on ARM that
  broke. Correcting it highlighted this issue.

- The deletion of slices, was not using ``Py_ssize`` for indexes, disallowing
  some kinds of optimization, so that was harmonized.

- The function call code generation got a general overhaul. It is now more
  consistent, has more helpers available, and creates more readable code.

- PyLint is again happier than ever.

New Tests
---------

- There is a new basic test ``OrderChecks`` that covers the order of expression
  evaluation. These problems were otherwise very hard to detect, and in some
  cases not previously covered at all.

- Executing Nuitka with Python3 (it won't produce correct Python3 C/API code) is
  now part of the release tests, so non-portable code of Nuitka gets caught.

Organizational
--------------

- Support for ARM Linux. I will make a separate posting on the challenges of
  this. Suffice to say now, that C++ leaves way too much things unspecified.

- The Nuitka git repository now uses "git flow". The new git policy will be
  detailed in another `separate posting
  <http://nuitka.net/posts/nuitka-git-flow.html>`__.

- There is an unstable ``develop`` branch in which the development occurs. For
  this release ca. 40 commits were done to this branch, before merging it. I am
  also doing more fine grained commits now.

- Unlike previously, there is ``master`` branch for the stable release.

- There is a script "make-dependency-graph.sh" (Update: meanwhile it was renamed
  to "make-dependency-graph.py") to produce a dependency graphs of Nuitka. I
  detected a couple of strange things through this.

- The Python3 ``__pycache__`` directories get removed too by the cleanup script.

Numbers
-------

We only have "PyStone" now, and on a new machine, so the numbers cannot be
compared to previous releases:

python 2.6::

  Pystone(1.1) time for 50000 passes = 0.48
  This machine benchmarks at 104167 pystones/second

Nuitka 0.3.11 (driven by python 2.6)::

  Pystone(1.1) time for 50000 passes = 0.19
  This machine benchmarks at 263158 pystones/second

So this a speedup factor of 258%, last time on another machine it was 240%. Yet
it only proves that the generated and compiled are more efficient than bytecode,
but Nuitka doesn't yet do the relevant optimization. Only once it does, the
factor will be significantly higher.

Summary
-------

Overall, there is quite some progress. Nuitka is a lot cleaner now, which will
help us later only. I wanted to get this out, mostly because of the bug fixes,
and of course just in case somebody attempts to use it on ARM.


Nuitka Release 0.3.10
=====================

This new release is major milestone 2 work, enhancing practically all areas of
Nuitka. The focus was roundup and breaking new grounds with structural
optimization enhancements.

Bug fixes
---------

- Exceptions now correctly stack.

  When you catch an exception, there always was the exception set, but calling a
  new function, and it catching the exception, the values of ``sys.exc_info()``
  didn't get reset after the function returned.

  This was a small difference (of which there are nearly none left now) but one
  that might effect existing code, which affects code that calls functions in
  exception handling to check something about it.

  So it's good this is resolved now too. Also because it is difficult to
  understand, and now it's just like CPython behaves, which means that we don't
  have to document anything at all about it.

- Using ``exec`` in generator functions got fixed up. I realized that this
  wouldn't work while working on other things. It's obscure yes, but it ought to
  work.

- Lambda generator functions can now be nested and in generator functions. There
  were some problems here with the allocation of closure variables that got
  resolved.

- List contractions could not be returned by lambda functions. Also a closure
  issue.

- When using a mapping for globals to ``exec`` or ``eval`` that had a side
  effect on lookup, it was evident that the lookup was made twice. Correcting
  this also improves the performance for the normal case.

New Optimization
----------------

- Statically raised as well as predicted exceptions are propagated upwards,
  leading to code and block removal where possible, while maintaining the side
  effects.

  This is brand new and doesn't do everything possible yet. Most notable, the
  matching of raised exception to handlers is not yet performed.

- Built-in exception name references and creation of instances of them are now
  optimized as well, which leads to faster exception raising/catching for these
  cases.

- More kinds of calls to built-ins are handled, positional parameters are
  checked and more built-ins are covered.

  Notable is that now checks are performed if you didn't potentially overload
  e.g. the ``len`` with your own version in the module. Locally it was always
  detected already. So it's now also safe.

- All operations and comparisons are now simulated if possible and replaced with
  their result.

- In the case of predictable true or false conditions, not taken branches are
  removed.

- Empty branches are now removed from most constructs, leading to sometimes
  cleaner code generated.

Cleanups
--------

- Removed the lambda body node and replaced it with function body. This is a
  great win for the split into body and builder. Regular functions and lambda
  functions now only differ in how the created body is used.

- Large cleanup of the operation/comparison code. There is now only use of a
  simulator function, which exists for every operator and comparison. This one
  is then used in a prediction call, shared with the built-in predictions.

- Added a ``Tracing`` module to avoid future imports of ``print_function``,
  which annoyed me many times by causing syntax failures for when I quickly
  added a print statement, not noting it must have the braces.

- PyLint is happier than ever.

New Tests
---------

- Enhanced ``OverflowFunctions`` test to cover even deeper nesting of overflow
  functions taking closure from each level. While it's not yet working, this
  makes clearer what will be needed. Even if this code is obscure, I would like
  to be that correct here.

- Made ``Operators`` test to cover the `` operator as well.

- Added to ``ListContractions`` the case where a contraction is returned by a
  lambda function, but still needs to leak its loop variable.

- Enhanced ``GeneratorExpressions`` test to cover lambda generators, which is
  really crazy code:

  .. code-block:: python

     def y():
         yield((yield 1),(yield 2))

- Added to ``ExecEval`` a case where the ``exec`` is inside a generator, to
  cover that too.

- Activated the testing of ``sys.exc_info()`` in ``ExceptionRaising`` test. This
  was previously commented out, and now I added stuff to illustrate all of the
  behavior of CPython there.

- Enhanced ``ComparisonChains`` test to demonstrate that the order of
  evaluations is done right and that side effects are maintained.

- Added ``BuiltinOverload`` test to show that overloaded built-ins are actually
  called and not the optimized version. So code like this has to print 2 lines:

  .. code-block:: python

     from __builtin__ import len as _len

     def len(x):
        print x

     return _len(x)

     print len(range(9))

Organizational
--------------

- Changed "README.txt" to no longer say that "Scons" is a requirement. Now that
  it's included (patched up to work with ``ctypes`` on Windows), we don't have
  to say that anymore.

- Documented the status of optimization and added some more ideas.

- There is now an option to dump the node tree after optimization as XML. Not
  currently use, but is for regression testing, to identify where new
  optimization and changes have an impact. This make it more feasible to be sure
  that Nuitka is only becoming better.

- Executable with Python3 again, although it won't do anything, the necessary
  code changes were done.

Summary
-------

It's nice to see, that I some long standing issues were resolved, and that
structural optimization has become almost a reality.

The difficult parts of exception propagation are all in place, now it's only
details. With that we can eliminate and predict even more of the stupid code of
"pybench" at compile time, achieving more infinite speedups.


Nuitka Release 0.3.9
====================

This is about the new release of Nuitka which some bug fixes and offers a good
speed improvement.

This new release is major milestone 2 work, enhancing practically all areas of
Nuitka. The main focus was on faster function calls, faster class attributes
(not instance), faster unpacking, and more built-ins detected and more
thoroughly optimizing them.

Bug fixes
---------

- Exceptions raised inside with statements had references to the exception and
  traceback leaked.

- On Windows the binaries ``sys.executable`` pointed to the binary itself
  instead of the Python interpreter. Changed, because some code uses
  ``sys.executable`` to know how to start Python scripts.

- There is a bug (fixed in their repository) related to C++ raw strings and C++
  "trigraphs" that affects Nuitka, added a workaround that makes Nuitka not emit
  "trigraphs" at all.

- The check for mutable constants was erroneous for tuples, which could lead to
  assuming a tuple with only mutable elements to be not mutable, which is of
  course wrong.

New Optimization
----------------

This time there are so many new optimization, it makes sense to group them by
the subject.

Exceptions
~~~~~~~~~~

- The code to add a traceback is now our own, which made it possible to use
  frames that do not contain line numbers and a code object capable of lookups.

- Raising exceptions or adding to tracebacks has been made way faster by reusing
  a cached frame objects for the task.

- The class used for saving exceptions temporarily (e.g. used in
  ``try``/``finally`` code, or with statement) has been improved so it doesn't
  make a copy of the exception with a C++ ``new`` call, but it simply stores the
  exception properties itself and creates the exception object only on demand,
  which is more efficient.

- When catching exceptions, the addition of tracebacks is now done without
  exporting and re-importing the exception to Python, but directly on the
  exception objects traceback, this avoids a useless round trip.

Function Calls
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

- Uses of PyObject_Call provide ``NULL`` as the dictionary, instead of an empty
  dictionary, which is slightly faster for function calls.

- There are now dedicated variants for complex function calls with ``*`` and
  ``**`` arguments in all forms. These can take advantage of easier cases. For
  example, a merge with star arguments is only needed if there actually were any
  of these.

- The check for non-string values in the ``**`` arguments can now be completely
  short-cut for the case of a dictionary that has never had a string
  added. There is now code that detects this case and skips the check,
  eliminating it as a performance concern.

Parameter Parsing
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

- Reversed the order in which parameters are checked.

  Now the keyword dictionary is iterated first and only then the positional
  arguments after that is done. This iteration is not only much faster (avoiding
  repeated lookups for each possible parameter), it also can be more correct, in
  case the keyword argument is derived from a dictionary and its keys mutate it
  when being compared.

- Comparing parameter names is now done with a fast path, in which the pointer
  values are compare first. This can avoid a call to the comparison at all,
  which has become very likely due to the interning of parameter name strings,
  see below.

- Added a dedicated call to check for parameter equality with rich equality
  comparison, which doesn't raise an exception.

- Unpacking of tuples is now using dedicated variants of the normal unpacking
  code instead of rolling out everything themselves.

Attribute Access
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

- The class type (in executables, not yet for extension modules) is changed to a
  faster variant of our own making that doesn't consider the restricted mode a
  possibility. This avoids very expensive calls, and makes accessing class
  attributes in compiled code and in non-compiled code faster.

- Access to attributes (but not of instances) got in-lined and therefore much
  faster. Due to other optimization, a specific step to intern the string used
  for attribute access is not necessary with Nuitka at all anymore. This made
  access to attributes about 50% faster which is big of course.

Constants
~~~~~~~~~

- The bug for mutable tuples also caused non-mutable tuples to be considered as
  mutable, which lead to less efficient code.

- The constant creation with the g++ bug worked around, can now use raw strings
  to create string constants, without resorting to un-pickling them as a work
  around. This allows us to use ``PyString_FromStringAndSize`` to create strings
  again, which is obviously faster, and had not been done, because of the
  confusion caused by the g++ bug.

- For string constants that are usable as attributes (i.e. match the identifier
  regular expression), these are now interned, directly after creation. With
  this, the check for identical value of pointers for parameters has a bigger
  chance to succeed, and this saves some memory too.

- For empty containers (set, dict, list, tuple) the constants created are now
  are not unstreamed, but created with the dedicated API calls, saving a bit of
  code and being less ugly.

- For mutable empty constant access (set, dict, list) the values are no longer
  made by copying the constant, but instead with the API functions to create new
  ones. This makes code like ``a = []`` a tiny bit faster.

- For slice indices the code generation now takes advantage of creating a C++
  ``Py_ssize_t`` from constant value if possible. Before it was converting the
  integer constant at run time, which was of course wasteful even if not (very)
  slow.

Iteration
~~~~~~~~~

- The creation of iterators got our own code. This avoids a function call and is
  otherwise only a small gain for anything but sequence iterators. These may be
  much faster to create now, as it avoids another call and repeated checks.

- The next on iterator got our own code too, which has simpler code flow,
  because it avoids the double check in case of NULL returned.

- The unpack check got simlar code to the next iterator, it also has simpler
  code flow now and avoids double checks.

Built-ins
~~~~~~~~~

- Added support for the ``list``, ``tuple``, ``dict``, ``str``, ``float`` and
  ``bool`` built-ins along with optimizing their use with constant parameter.

- Added support for the ``int`` and ``long`` built-ins, based on a new "call
  spec" object, that detects parameter errors at compile time and raises
  appropriate exceptions as required, plus it deals with keyword arguments just
  as well.

  So, to Nuitka it doesn't matter now it you write ``int(value) ``or ``int(x =
  value)`` anymore. The ``base`` parameter of these built-ins is also supported.

  The use of this call spec mechanism will the expanded, currently it is not
  applied to the built-ins that take only one parameter. This is a work in
  progress as is the whole built-ins business as not all the built-ins are
  covered yet.

Cleanups
~~~~~~~~

- In 0.3.8 per module global classes were introduced, but the ``IMPORT_MODULE``
  kept using the old universal class, this got resolved and the old class is now
  fully gone.

- Using ``assertObject`` in more cases, and in more places at all, catches
  errors earlier on.

- Moved the addition to tracebacks into the ``_PythonException`` class, where it
  works directly on the contained traceback. This is cleaner as it no longer
  requires to export exceptions to Python, just to add a traceback entry.

- Some ``PyLint`` cleanups were done, reducing the number of reports a bit, but
  there is still a lot to do.

- Added a ``DefaultValueIdentifier`` class that encapsulates the access to
  default values in the parameter parsing more cleanly.

- The module ``CodeTemplatesListContractions`` was renamed to
  ``CodeTemplatesContractions`` to reflect the fact that it deals with all kinds
  of contractions (also set and dict contractions), not just list contractions.

- Moved the with related template to its own module ``CodeTemplatesWith``, so
  its easier to find.

- The options handling for g++ based compilers was cleaned up, so that g++ 4.6
  and MinGW are better supported now.

- Documented more aspects of the Scons build file.

- Some more generated code white space fixes.

- Moved some helpers to dedicated files. There is now ``calling.hpp`` for
  function calls, an ``importing.cpp`` for import related stuff.

- Moved the manifest generation to the scons file, which now produces ready to
  use executables.

New Tests
---------

- Added a improved version of "pybench" that can cope with the "0 ms" execution
  time that Nuitka has for some if its sub-tests.

- Reference counting test for with statement was added.

- Micro benchmarks to demonstrate try finally performance when an exception
  travels through it.

- Micro benchmark for with statement that eats up exceptions raised inside the
  block.

- Micro benchmarks for the read and write access to class attributes.

- Enhanced ``Printing`` test to cover the trigraphs constant bug case. Output is
  required to make the error detectable.

- Enhanced ``Constants`` test to cover repeated mutation of mutable tuple
  constants, this covers the bug mentioned.

Organizational
--------------

- Added a credits section to the "README.txt" where I give credit to the people
  who contributed to Nuitka, and the projects it is using. I will make it a
  separate posting to cite these.

- Documented the requirements on the compiler more clearly, document the fact
  that we require scons and which version of Python (2.6 or 2.7).

- The is now a codespeed implementation up and running with historical data for
  up to Nuitka 0.3.8 runs of "PyStone" and with pybench. It will be updated for
  0.3.9 once I have the infrastructure in place to do that automatically.

- The cleanup script now also removes .so files.

- The handling of options for g++ got improved, so it's the same for g++ and
  MinGW compilers, plus adequate errors messages are given, if the compiler
  version is too low.

- There is now a ``--unstriped`` option that just keeps the debug information in
  the file, but doesn't keep the assertions. This will be helpful when looking
  at generated assembler code from Nuitka to not have the distortions that
  ``--debug`` causes (reduced optimization level, assertions, etc.) and instead
  a clear view.


Nuitka Release 0.3.8
====================

This is to inform you about the new release of Nuitka with some real news and a
slight performance increase. The significant news is added "Windows
Support". You can now hope to run Nuitka on Windows too and have it produce
working executables against either the standard Python distribution or a MinGW
compiled Python.

There are still some small things to iron out, and clearly documentation needs
to be created, and esp. the DLL hell problem of ``msvcr90.dll``
vs. ``msvcrt.dll``, is not yet fully resolved, but appears to be not as harmful,
at least not on native Windows.

I am thanking Khalid Abu Bakr for making this possible.  I was surprised to see
this happen. I clearly didn't make it easy. He found a good way around
``ucontext``, identifier clashes, and a very tricky symbol problems where the
CPython library under Windows exports less than under Linux. Thanks a whole lot.

Currently the Windows support is considered experimental and works with MinGW
4.5 or higher only.

Otherwise there have been the usual round of performance improvements and more
cleanups. This release is otherwise milestone 2 work only, which will have to
continue for some time more.

Bug fixes
---------

- Lambda generators were not fully compatible, their simple form could yield an
  extra value. The behavior for Python 2.6 and 2.7 is also different and Nuitka
  now mimics both correctly, depending on the used Python version

- The given parameter count cited in the error message in case of too many
  parameters, didn't include the given keyword parameters in the error message.

- There was an ``assert False`` right after warning about not found modules in
  the ``--deep`` mode, which was of course unnecessary.

New Optimization
----------------

- When unpacking variables in assignments, the temporary variables are now held
  in a new temporary class that is designed for the task specifically.

  This avoids the taking of a reference just because the ``PyObjectTemporary``
  destructor insisted on releasing one. The new class ``PyObjectTempHolder``
  hands the existing reference over and releases only in case of exceptions.

- When unpacking variable in for loops, the value from the iterator may be
  directly assigned, if it's to a variable.

  In general this would be possible for every assignment target that cannot
  raise, but the infrastructure cannot tell yet, which these would be. This will
  improve with more milestone 3 work.

- Branches with only ``pass`` inside are removed, ``pass`` statements are
  removed before the code generation stage. This makes it easier to achieve and
  decide empty branches.

- There is now a global variable class per module. It appears that it is indeed
  faster to roll out a class per module accessing the ``module *`` rather than
  having one class and use a ``module **``, which is quite disappointing from
  the C++ compiler.

- Also ``MAKE_LIST`` and ``MAKE_TUPLE`` have gained special cases for the 0
  arguments case. Even when the size of the variadic template parameters should
  be known to the compiler, it seems, it wasn't eliminating the branch, so this
  was a speedup measured with valgrind.

- Empty tried branches are now replaced when possible with ``try``/``except``
  statements, ``try``/``finally`` is simplified in this case. This gives a
  cleaner tree structure and less verbose C++ code which the compiler threw
  away, but was strange to have in the first place.

- In conditions the ``or`` and ``and`` were evaluated with Python objects
  instead of with C++ bool, which was unnecessary overhead.

- List contractions got more clever in how they assign from the iterator value.

  It now uses a ``PyObjectTemporary`` if it's assigned to multiple values, a
  ``PyObjectTempHolder`` if it's only assigned once, to something that could
  raise, or a ``PyObject *`` if an exception cannot be raised. This avoids
  temporary references completely for the common case.

Cleanups
--------

- The ``if``, ``for``, and ``while`` statements had always empty ``else`` nodes
  which were then also in the generated C++ code as empty branches. No harm to
  performance, but this got cleaned up.

- Some more generated code white space fixes.

New Tests
---------

- The CPython 2.7 test suite now also has the ``doctests`` extracted to static
  tests, which improves test coverage for Nuitka again.

  This was previously only done for CPython 2.6 test suite, but the test suites
  are different enough to make this useful, e.g. to discover newly changed
  behavior like with the lambda generators.

- Added Shed Skin 0.7.1 examples as benchmarks, so we can start to compare
  Nuitka performance in these tests. These will be the focus of numbers for the
  0.4.x release series.

- Added a micro benchmark to check unpacking behavior. Some of these are needed
  to prove that a change is an actual improvement, when its effect can go under
  in noise of in-line vs. no in-line behavior of the C++ compiler.

- Added "pybench" benchmark which reveals that Nuitka is for some things much
  faster, but there are still fields to work on. This version needed changes to
  stand the speed of Nuitka. These will be subject of a later posting.

Organizational
--------------

- There is now a "tests/benchmarks/micro" directory to contain tiny benchmarks
  that just look at a single aspect, but have no other meaning, e.g. the
  "PyStone" extracts fall into this category.

- There is now a ``--windows-target`` option that attempts a cross-platform
  build on Linux to Windows executable. This is using "MingGW-cross-env" cross
  compilation tool chain. It's not yet working fully correctly due to the DLL
  hell problem with the C runtime. I hope to get this right in subsequent
  releases.

- The ``--execute`` option uses wine to execute the binary if it's a
  cross-compile for windows.

- Native windows build is recognized and handled with MinGW 4.5, the VC++ is not
  supported yet due to missing C++0x support.

- The basic test suite ran with Windows so far only and some adaptations were
  necessary. Windows new lines are now ignored in difference check, and
  addresses under Windows are upper case, small things.

Numbers
-------

python 2.6::

  Pystone(1.1) time for 50000 passes = 0.65
  This machine benchmarks at 76923.1 pystones/second

Nuitka 0.3.8 (driven by python 2.6)::

  Pystone(1.1) time for 50000 passes = 0.27
  This machine benchmarks at 185185 pystones/second

This is a 140% speed increase of 0.3.8 compared to CPython, up from 132%
compared to the previous release.


Nuitka Release 0.3.7
====================

This is about the new release with focus on performance and cleanups. It
indicates significant progress with the milestone this release series really is
about as it adds a ``compiled_method`` type.

So far functions, generator function, generator expressions were compiled
objects, but in the context of classes, functions were wrapped in CPython
``instancemethod`` objects. The new ``compiled_method`` is specifically designed
for wrapping ``compiled_function`` and therefore more efficient at it.

Bug fixes
---------

- When using ``Python`` or ``Nuitka.py`` to execute some script, the exit code
  in case of "file not found" was not the same as CPython. It should be 2,
  not 1.

- The exit code of the created programs (``--deep`` mode) in case of an uncaught
  exception was 0, now it an error exit with value 1, like CPython does it.

- Exception tracebacks created inside ``with`` statements could contain
  duplicate lines, this was corrected.

New Optimization
----------------

- Global variable assignments now also use ``assign0`` where no reference
  exists.

  The assignment code for module variables is actually faster if it needs not
  drop the reference, but clearly the code shouldn't bother to take it on the
  outside just for that. This variant existed, but wasn't used as much so far.

- The instance method objects are now Nuitka's own compiled type too. This
  should make things slightly faster by itself.

- Our new compiled method objects support dedicated method parsing code, where
  ``self`` is passed directly, allowing to make calls taking a fast path in
  parameter parsing.

  This avoids allocating/freeing a ``tuple`` object per method call, while
  reduced 3% ticks in "PyStone" benchmark, so that's significant.

- Solved a ``TODO`` of ``BUILTIN_RANGE`` to change it to pre-allocating the list
  in the final size as we normally do everywhere else. This was a tick reduction
  of 0.4% in "PyStone" benchmark, but the measurement method normalizes on loop
  speed, so it's not visible in the numbers output.

- Parameter variables cannot possibly be uninitialized at creation and most
  often they are never subject to a ``del`` statement. Adding dedicated C++
  variable classes gave a big speedup, around 3% of "PyStone" benchmark ticks.

- Some abstract object operations were re-implemented, which allows to avoid
  function calls e.g. in the ``ITERATOR_NEXT`` case, this gave a few percent on
  "PyStone" as well.

Cleanups
--------

- New package ``nuitka.codegen`` to contain all code generation related stuff,
  moved ``nuitka.templates`` to ``nuitka.codegen.templates`` as part of that.

- Inside the ``nuitka.codegen`` package the ``MainControl`` module now longer
  reaches into ``Generator`` for simple things, but goes through
  ``CodeGeneration`` for everything now.

- The ``Generator`` module uses almost no tree nodes anymore, but instead gets
  information passed in function calls. This allows for a cleanup of the
  interface towards ``CodeGeneration``. Gives a cleaner view on the C++ code
  generation, and generally furthers the goal of other than C++ language
  backends.

- More "PyLint" work, many of the reported warnings have been addressed, but
  it's not yet happy.

- Defaults for ``yield`` and ``return`` are ``None`` and these values are now
  already added (as constants) during tree building so that no such special
  cases need to be dealt with in ``CodeGeneration`` and future analysis steps.

- Parameter parsing code has been unified even further, now the whole entry
  point is generated by one of the function in the new
  ``nuitka.codegen.ParameterParsing`` module.

- Split variable, exception, built-in helper classes into separate header files.

New Tests
---------

- The exit codes of CPython execution and Nuitka compiled programs are now
  compared as well.

- Errors messages of methods are now covered by the ``ParameterErrors`` test as
  well.

Organizational
--------------

- A new script "benchmark.sh" (now called "run-valgrind.py") script now starts
  "kcachegrind" to display the valgrind result directly.

  One can now use it to execute a test and inspect valgrind information right
  away, then improve it. Very useful to discover methods for improvements, test
  them, then refine some more.

- The "check-release.sh" script needs to unset ``NUITKA_EXTRA_OPTIONS`` or else
  the reflection test will trip over the changed output paths.

Numbers
-------

python 2.6::

  Pystone(1.1) time for 50000 passes = 0.65
  This machine benchmarks at 76923.1 pystones/second

Nuitka 0.3.7 (driven by python 2.6)::

  Pystone(1.1) time for 50000 passes = 0.28
  This machine benchmarks at 178571 pystones/second

This is a 132% speed of 0.3.7 compared to CPython, up from 109% compare to the
previous release. This is a another small increase, that can be fully attributed
to milestone 2 measures, i.e. not analysis, but purely more efficient C++ code
generation and the new compiled method type.

One can now safely assume that it is at least twice as fast, but I will try and
get the PyPy or Shedskin test suite to run as benchmarks to prove it.

No milestone 3 work in this release. I believe it's best to finish with
milestone 2 first, because these are quite universal gains that we should have
covered.


Nuitka Release 0.3.6
====================

The major point this for this release is cleanup work, and generally bug fixes,
esp. in the field of importing. This release cleans up many small open ends of
Nuitka, closing quite a bunch of consistency ``TODO`` items, and then aims at
cleaner structures internally, so optimization analysis shall become "easy". It
is a correctness and framework release, not a performance improvement at all.

Bug fixes
---------

- Imports were not respecting the ``level`` yet. Code like this was not working,
  now it is:

  .. code-block:: python

     from .. import something

- Absolute and relative imports were e.g. both tried all the time, now if you
  specify absolute or relative imports, it will be attempted in the same way
  than CPython does. This can make a difference with compatibility.

- Functions with a "locals dict" (using ``locals`` built-in or ``exec``
  statement) were not 100% compatible in the way the locals dictionary was
  updated, this got fixed. It seems that directly updating a dict is not what
  CPython does at all, instead it only pushes things to the dictionary, when it
  believes it has to. Nuitka now does the same thing, making it faster and more
  compatible at the same time with these kind of corner cases.

- Nested packages didn't work, they do now. Nuitka itself is now successfully
  using nested packages (e.g. ``nuitka.transform.optimizations``)

New Features
------------

- The ``--lto`` option becomes usable. It's not measurably faster immediately,
  and it requires g++ 4.6 to be available, but then it at least creates smaller
  binaries and may provide more optimization in the future.

New Optimization
----------------

- Exceptions raised by pre-computed built-ins, unpacking, etc. are now
  transformed to raising the exception statically.

Cleanups
--------

- There is now a ``getVariableForClosure`` that a variable provider can
  use. Before that it guessed from ``getVariableForReference`` or
  ``getVariableForAssignment`` what might be the intention. This makes some
  corner cases easier.

- Classes, functions and lambdas now also have separate builder and body nodes,
  which enabled to make getSameScopeNodes() really simple. Either something has
  children which are all in a new scope or it has them in the same scope.

- Twisted workarounds like ``TransitiveProvider`` are no longer needed, because
  class builder and class body were separated.

- New packages ``nuitka.transform.optimizations`` and
  ``nuitka.transform.finalizations``, where the first was
  ``nuitka.optimizations`` before. There is also code in ``nuitka.transform``
  that was previously in a dedicated module. This allowed to move a lot of
  displaced code.

- ``TreeBuilding`` now has fast paths for all 3 forms, things that need a
  "provider", "node", and "source_ref"; things that need "node" and
  "source_ref"; things that need nothing at all, e.g. pass.

- Variables now avoid building duplicated instances, but instead share
  one. Better for analysis of them.

New Tests
---------

- The Python 2.7 test suite is no longer run with Python 2.6 as it will just
  crash with the same exception all the time, there is no ``importlib`` in 2.6,
  but every test is using that through test_support.

- Nested packages are now covered with tests too.

- Imports of upper level packages are covered now too.

Organizational
--------------

- Updated the "README.txt" with the current plan on optimization.

Numbers
-------

python 2.6::

  Pystone(1.1) time for 50000 passes = 0.65
  This machine benchmarks at 76923.1 pystones/second

Nuitka 0.3.6 (driven by python 2.6)::

  Pystone(1.1) time for 50000 passes = 0.31
  This machine benchmarks at 161290 pystones/second

This is 109% for 0.3.6, but no change from the previous release. No surprise,
because no new effective new optimization means have been implemented. Stay
tuned for future release for actual progress.


Nuitka Release 0.3.5
====================

This new release of Nuitka is an overall improvement on many fronts, there is no
real focus this time, likely due to the long time it was in the making.

The major points are more optimization work, largely enhanced import handling
and another improvement on the performance side. But there are also many bug
fixes, more test coverage, usability and compatibility.

Something esp. noteworthy to me and valued is that many important changes were
performed or at least triggered by Nicolas Dumazet, who contributed a lot of
high quality commits as you can see from the gitweb history. He appears to try
and compile Mercurial and Nuitka, and this resulted in important contributions.

Bug fixes
---------

- Nicolas found a reference counting bug with nested parameter calls. Where a
  function had parameters of the form ``a, (b,c)`` it could crash. This got
  fixed and covered with a reference count test.

- Another reference count problem when accessing the locals dictionary was
  corrected.

- Values ``0.0`` and ``-0.0`` were treated as the same. They are not though,
  they have a different sign that should not get lost.

- Nested contractions didn't work correctly, when the contraction was to iterate
  over another contraction which needs a closure. The problem was addressing by
  splitting the building of a contraction from the body of the contraction, so
  that these are now 2 nodes, making it easy for the closure handling to get
  things right.

- Global statements in function with local ``exec()`` would still use the value
  from the locals dictionary. Nuitka is now compatible to CPython with this too.

- Nicolas fixed problems with modules of the same name inside different
  packages. We now use the full name including parent package names for code
  generation and look-ups.

- The ``__module__`` attribute of classes was only set after the class was
  created. Now it is already available in the class body.

- The ``__doc__`` attribute of classes was not set at all. Now it is.

- The relative import inside nested packages now works correctly. With Nicolas
  moving all of Nuitka to a package, the compile itself exposed many weaknesses.

- A local re-raise of an exception didn't have the original line attached but
  the re-raise statement line.

New Features
------------

- Modules and packages have been unified. Packages can now also have code in
  "__init__.py" and then it will be executed when the package is imported.

- Nicolas added the ability to create deep output directory structures without
  having to create them beforehand. This makes ``--output-dir=some/deep/path``
  usable.

- Parallel build by Scons was added as an option and enabled by default, which
  enhances scalability for ``--deep`` compilations a lot.

- Nicolas enhanced the CPU count detection used for the parallel build. Turned
  out that ``multithreading.cpu_count()`` doesn't give us the number of
  available cores, so he contributed code to determine that.

- Support for upcoming g++ 4.6 has been added. The use of the new option
  ``--lto`` has been been prepared, but right now it appears that the C++
  compiler will need more fixes, before we can this feature with Nuitka.

- The ``--display-tree`` feature got an overhaul and now displays the node tree
  along with the source code. It puts the cursor on the line of the node you
  selected. Unfortunately I cannot get it to work two-way yet. I will ask for
  help with this in a separate posting as we can really use a "python-qt" expert
  it seems.

- Added meaningful error messages in the "file not found" case. Previously I
  just didn't care, but we sort of approach end user usability with this.

New Optimization
----------------

- Added optimization for the built-in ``range()`` which otherwise requires a
  module and ``builtin`` module lookup, then parameter parsing. Now this is much
  faster with Nuitka and small ranges (less than 256 values) are converted to
  constants directly, avoiding run time overhead entirely.

- Code for re-raise statements now use a simple re-throw of the exception where
  possible, and only do the hard work where the re-throw is not inside an
  exception handler.

- Constant folding of operations and comparisons is now performed if the
  operands are constants.

- Values of some built-ins are pre-computed if the operands are constants.

- The value of module attribute ``__name__`` is replaced by a constant unless it
  is assigned to. This is the first sign of upcoming constant propagation, even
  if only a weak one.

- Conditional statement and/or their branches are eliminated where constant
  conditions allow it.

Cleanups
--------

- Nicolas moved the Nuitka source code to its own ``nuitka`` package. That is
  going to make packaging it a lot easier and allows cleaner code.

- Nicolas introduced a fast path in the tree building which often delegates (or
  should do that) to a function. This reduced a lot of the dispatching code and
  highlights more clearly where such is missing right now.

- Together we worked on the line length issues of Nuitka. We agreed on a style
  and very long lines will vanish from Nuitka with time. Thanks for pushing me
  there.

- Nicolas also did provide many style fixes and general improvements, e.g. using
  ``PyObjectTemporary`` in more places in the C++ code, or not using
  ``str.find`` where ``x in y`` is a better choice.

- The node structure got cleaned up towards the direction that assigments always
  have an assignment as a child. A function definition, or a class definition,
  are effectively assignments, and in order to not have to treat this as special
  cases everywhere, they need to have assignment targets as child nodes.

  Without such changes, optimization will have to take too many things into
  account. This is not yet completed.

- Nicolas merged some node tree building functions that previously handled
  deletion and assigning differently, giving us better code reuse.

- The constants code generation was moved to a ``__constants.cpp`` where it
  doesn't make __main__.cpp so much harder to read anymore.

- The module declarations have been moved to their own header files.

- Nicolas cleaned up the scripts used to test Nuitka big time, removing
  repetitive code and improving the logic. Very much appreciated.

- Nicolas also documented a things in the Nuitka source code or got me to
  document things that looked strange, but have reasons behind it.

- Nicolas solved the ``TODO`` related to built-in module accesses. These will
  now be way faster than before.

- Nicolas also solved the ``TODO`` related to the performance of "locals dict"
  variable accesses.

- Generator.py no longer contains classes. The Contexts objects are supposed to
  contain the state, and as such the generator objects never made much sense.

- Also with the help of Scons community, I figured out how to avoid having
  object files inside the ``src`` directory of Nuitka. That should also help
  packaging, now all build products go to the .build directory as they should.

- The vertical white space of the generated C++ got a few cleanups,
  trailing/leading new line is more consistent now, and there were some
  assertions added that it doesn't happen.

New Tests
---------

- The CPython 2.6 tests are now also run by CPython 2.7 and the other way around
  and need to report the same test failure reports, which found a couple of
  issues.

- Now the test suite is run with and without ``--debug`` mode.

- Basic tests got extended to cover more topics and catch more issues.

- Program tests got extended to cover code in packages.

- Added more exec scope tests. Currently inlining of exec statements is disabled
  though, because it requires entirely different rules to be done right, it has
  been pushed back to the next release.

Organizational
--------------

- The ``g++-nuitka`` script is no more. With the help of the Scons community,
  this is now performed inside the scons and only once instead of each time for
  every C++ file.

- When using ``--debug``, the generated C++ is compiled with ``-Wall`` and
  ``-Werror`` so that some form of bugs in the generated C++ code will be
  detected immediately. This found a few issues already.

- There is a new git merge policy in place. Basically it says, that if you
  submit me a pull request, that I will deal with it before publishing anything
  new, so you can rely on the current git to provide you a good base to work
  on. I am doing more frequent pre-releases already and I would like to merge
  from your git.

- The "README.txt" was updated to reflect current optimization status and
  plans. There is still a lot to do before constant propagation can work, but
  this explains things a bit better now. I hope to expand this more and more
  with time.

- There is now a "misc/clean-up.sh" script that prints the commands to erase all
  the temporary files sticking around in the source tree. That is for you if you
  like me, have other directories inside, ignored, that you don't want to
  delete.

- Then there is now a script that prints all source filenames, so you can more
  easily open them all in your editor.

- And very important, there is now a "check-release.sh" script that performs all
  the tests I think should be done before making a release.

- Pylint got more happy with the current Nuitka source. In some places, I added
  comments where rules should be granted exceptions.

Numbers
-------

python 2.6::

  Pystone(1.1) time for 50000 passes = 0.65
  This machine benchmarks at 76923.1 pystones/second

Nuitka 0.3.5 (driven by python 2.6)::

  Pystone(1.1) time for 50000 passes = 0.31
  This machine benchmarks at 161290 pystones/second

This is 109% for 0.3.5, up from 91% before.

Overall this release is primarily an improvement in the domain of compatibility
and contains important bug and feature fixes to the users. The optimization
framework only makes a first showing of with the framework to organize
them. There is still work to do to migrate optimization previously present

It will take more time before we will see effect from these. I believe that even
more cleanups of ``TreeBuilding``, ``Nodes`` and ``CodeGeneration`` will be
required, before everything is in place for the big jump in performance
numbers. But still, passing 100% feels good. Time to rejoice.


Nuitka Release 0.3.4
====================

This new release of Nuitka has a focus on re-organizing the Nuitka generated
source code and a modest improvement on the performance side.

For a long time now, Nuitka has generated a single C++ file and asked the C++
compiler to translate it to an executable or shared library for CPython to
load. This was done even when embedding many modules into one (the "deep"
compilation mode, option ``--deep``).

This was simple to do and in theory ought to allow the compiler to do the most
optimization. But for large programs, the resulting source code could have
exponential compile time behavior in the C++ compiler. At least for the GNU g++
this was the case, others probably as well. This is of course at the end a
scalability issue of Nuitka, which now has been addressed.

So the major advancement of this release is to make the ``--deep`` option
useful. But also there have been a performance improvements, which end up giving
us another boost for the "PyStone" benchmark.

Bug fixes
---------

- Imports of modules local to packages now work correctly, closing the small
  compatibility gap that was there.

- Modules with a "-" in their name are allowed in CPython through dynamic
  imports. This lead to wrong C++ code created. (Thanks to Li Xuan Ji for
  reporting and submitting a patch to fix it.)

- There were warnings about wrong format used for ``Ssize_t`` type of
  CPython. (Again, thanks to Li Xuan Ji for reporting and submitting the patch
  to fix it.)

- When a wrong exception type is raised, the traceback should still be the one
  of the original one.

- Set and dict contractions (Python 2.7 features) declared local variables for
  global variables used. This went unnoticed, because list contractions don't
  generate code for local variables at all, as they cannot have such.

- Using the ``type()`` built-in to create a new class could attribute it to the
  wrong module, this is now corrected.

New Features
------------

- Uses Scons to execute the actual C++ build, giving some immediate
  improvements.

- Now caches build results and Scons will only rebuild as needed.

- The direct use of ``__import__()`` with a constant module name as parameter is
  also followed in "deep" mode. With time, non-constants may still become
  predictable, right now it must be a real CPython constant string.

New Optimization
----------------

- Added optimization for the built-ins ``ord()`` and ``chr()``, these require a
  module and built-in module lookup, then parameter parsing. Now these are
  really quick with Nuitka.

- Added optimization for the ``type()`` built-in with one parameter. As above,
  using from builtin module can be very slow. Now it is instantaneous.

- Added optimization for the ``type()`` built-in with three parameters. It's
  rarely used, but providing our own variant, allowed to fix the bug mentioned
  above.

Cleanups
--------

- Using scons is a big cleanup for the way how C++ compiler related options are
  applied. It also makes it easier to re-build without Nuitka, e.g. if you were
  using Nuitka in your packages, you can easily build in the same way than
  Nuitka does.

- Static helpers source code has been moved to ".hpp" and ".cpp" files, instead
  of being in ".py" files. This makes C++ compiler messages more readable and
  allows us to use C++ mode in Emacs etc., making it easier to write things.

- Generated code for each module ends up in a separate file per module or
  package.

- Constants etc. go to their own file (although not named sensible yet, likely
  going to change too)

- Module variables are now created by the ``CPythonModule`` node only and are
  unique, this is to make optimization of these feasible. This is a pre-step to
  module variable optimization.

New Tests
---------

- Added "ExtremeClosure" from my Python quiz, it was not covered by existing
  tests.

- Added test case for program that imports a module with a dash in its name.

- Added test case for main program that starts with a dash.

- Extended the built-in tests to cover ``type()`` as well.

Organizational
--------------

- There is now a new environment variable ``NUITKA_SCONS`` which should point to
  the directory with the ``SingleExe.scons`` file for Nuitka. The scons file
  could be named better, because it is actually one and the same who builds
  extension modules and executables.

- There is now a new environment variable ``NUITKA_CPP`` which should point to
  the directory with the C++ helper code of Nuitka.

- The script "create-environment.sh" can now be sourced (if you are in the top
  level directory of Nuitka) or be used with eval. In either case it also
  reports what it does.

  .. admonition:: Update

     The script has become obsolete now, as the environment variables are no
     longer necessary.

- To cleanup the many "Program.build" directories, there is now a "clean-up.sh"
  script for your use. Can be handy, but if you use git, you may prefer its
  clean command.

  .. admonition:: Update

     The script has become obsolete now, as Nuitka test executions now by
     default delete the build results.

Numbers
-------

python 2.6::

Nuitka 0.3.4::

  Pystone(1.1) time for 50000 passes = 0.34
  This machine benchmarks at 147059 pystones/second

This is 91% for 0.3.4, up from 80% before.


Nuitka Release 0.3.3
====================

This release of Nuitka continues the focus on performance. It also cleans up a
few open topics. One is "doctests", these are now extracted from the CPython 2.6
test suite more completely. The other is that the CPython 2.7 test suite is now
passed completely. There is some more work ahead though, to extract all of the
"doctests" and to do that for both versions of the tests.

This means an even higher level of compatibility has been achieved, then there
is performance improvements, and ever cleaner structure.

Bug fixes
---------

Generators
~~~~~~~~~~

- Generator functions tracked references to the common and the instance context
  independently, now the common context is not released before the instance
  contexts are.

- Generator functions didn't check the arguments to ``throw()`` the way they are
  in CPython, now they are.

- Generator functions didn't trace exceptions to "stderr" if they occurred while
  closing unfinished ones in "del".

- Generator functions used the slightly different wordings for some error
  messages.

Function Calls
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

- Extended call syntax with ``**`` allows that to use a mapping, and it is now
  checked if it really is a mapping and if the contents has string keys.

- Similarly, extended call syntax with ``*`` allows a sequence, it is now
  checked if it really is a sequence.

- Error message for duplicate keyword arguments or too little arguments now
  describe the duplicate parameter and the callable the same way CPython does.

- Now checks to the keyword argument list first before considering the parameter
  counts. This is slower in the error case, but more compatible with CPython.

Classes
~~~~~~~

- The "locals()" built-in when used in the class scope (not in a method) now is
  correctly writable and writes to it change the resulting class.

- Name mangling for private identifiers was not always done entirely correct.

Others
~~~~~~

- Exceptions didn't always have the correct stack reported.

- The pickling of some tuples showed that "cPickle" can have non-reproducible
  results, using "pickle" to stream constants now

New Optimization
----------------

- Access to instance attributes has become faster by writing specific code for
  the case. This is done in JIT way, attempting at run time to optimize
  attribute access for instances.

- Assignments now often consider what's cheaper for the other side, instead of
  taking a reference to a global variable, just to have to release it.

- The function call code built argument tuples and dictionaries as constants,
  now that is true for every tuple usage.

Cleanups
--------

- The static helper classes, and the prelude code needed have been moved to
  separate C++ files and are now accessed "#include". This makes the code inside
  C++ files as opposed to a Python string and therefore easier to read and or
  change.

New Features
------------

- The generator functions and generator expressions have the attribute
  "gi_running" now. These indicate if they are currently running.

New Tests
---------

- The script to extract the "doctests" from the CPython test suite has been
  rewritten entirely and works with more doctests now. Running these tests
  created increased the test coverage a lot.

- The Python 2.7 test suite has been added.

Organizational
--------------

- One can now run multiple "compare_with_cpython" instances in parallel, which
  enables background test runs.

- There is now a new environment variable "NUITKA_INCLUDE" which needs to point
  to the directory Nuitka's C++ includes live in. Of course the
  "create-environment.sh" script generates that for you easily.

Numbers
-------

python 2.6::

  Pystone(1.1) time for 50000 passes = 0.65
  This machine benchmarks at 76923.1 pystones/second

Nuitka 0.3.3::

   Pystone(1.1) time for 50000 passes = 0.36
   This machine benchmarks at 138889 pystones/second

This is 80% for 0.3.3, up from 66% before.


Nuitka Release 0.3.2
====================

This release of Nuitka continues the focus on performance. But this release also
revisits the topic of feature parity. Before, feature parity had been reached
"only" with Python 2.6. This is of course a big thing, but you know there is
always more, e.g. Python 2.7.

With the addition of set contractions and dict contractions in this very
release, Nuitka is approaching Python support for 2.7, and then there are some
bug fixes.

Bug fixes
---------

- Calling a function with ``**`` and using a non-dict for it was leading to
  wrong behavior. Now a mapping is good enough as input for the ``**`` parameter
  and it's checked.

- Deeply nested packages "package.subpackage.module" were not found and gave a
  warning from Nuitka, with the consequence that they were not embedded in the
  executable. They now are.

- Some error messages for wrong parameters didn't match literally. For example
  "function got multiple..." as opposed to "function() got multiple..." and
  alike.

- Files that ended in line with a "#" but without a new line gave an error from
  "ast.parse". As a workaround, a new line is added to the end of the file if
  it's "missing".

- More correct exception locations for complex code lines. I noted that the
  current line indication should not only be restored when the call at hand
  failed, but in any case. Otherwise sometimes the exception stack would not be
  correct. It now is - more often. Right now, this has no systematic test.

- Re-raised exceptions didn't appear on the stack if caught inside the same
  function, these are now correct.

- For ``exec`` the globals argument needs to have "__builtins__" added, but the
  check was performed with the mapping interface. That is not how CPython does
  it, and so e.g. the mapping could use a default value for "__builtins__" which
  could lead to incorrect behavior. Clearly a corner case, but one that works
  fully compatible now.

New Optimization
----------------

- The local and shared local variable C++ classes have a flag "free_value" to
  indicate if an "PY_DECREF" needs to be done when releasing the object. But
  still the code used "Py_XDECREF" (which allows for "NULL" values to be
  ignored.) when the releasing of the object was done. Now the inconsistency of
  using "NULL" as "object" value with "free_value" set to true was removed.

- Tuple constants were copied before using them without a point. They are
  immutable anyway.

Cleanups
--------

- Improved more of the indentation of the generated C++ which was not very good
  for contractions so far. Now it is. Also assignments should be better now.

- The generation of code for contractions was made more general and templates
  split into multiple parts. This enabled reuse of the code for list
  contractions in dictionary and set contractions.

- The with statement has its own template now and got cleaned up regarding
  indentation.

New Tests
---------

- There is now a script to extract the "doctests" from the CPython test suite
  and it generates Python source code from them. This can be compiled with
  Nuitka and output compared to CPython. Without this, the doctest parts of the
  CPython test suite is mostly useless. Solving this improved test coverage,
  leading to many small fixes. I will dedicate a later posting to the tool,
  maybe it is useful in other contexts as well.

- Reference count tests have been expanded to cover assignment to multiple
  assignment targets, and to attributes.

- The deep program test case, now also have a module in a sub-package to cover
  this case as well.

Organizational
--------------

- The `gitweb interface <http://nuitka.net/gitweb>`__ might be considered an
  alternative to downloading the source if you want to provide a pointer, or
  want to take a quick glance at the source code. You can already download with
  git, follow the link below to the page explaining it.

- The "README.txt" has documented more of the differences and I consequently
  updated the Differences page. There is now a distinction between generally
  missing functionality and things that don't work in ``--deep`` mode, where
  Nuitka is supposed to create one executable.

  I will make it a priority to remove the (minor) issues of ``--deep`` mode in
  the next release, as this is only relatively little work, and not a good
  difference to have. We want these to be empty, right? But for the time being,
  I document the known differences there.

Numbers
-------

python 2.6::

  Pystone(1.1) time for 50000 passes = 0.65
  This machine benchmarks at 76923.1 pystones/second

Nuitka 0.3.2::

  Pystone(1.1) time for 50000 passes = 0.39
  This machine benchmarks at 128205 pystones/second

This is 66% for 0.3.2, slightly up from the 58% of 0.3.1 before. The
optimization done were somewhat fruitful, but as you can see, they were also
more cleanups, not the big things.


Nuitka Release 0.3.1
====================

This release of Nuitka continues the focus on performance and contains only
cleanups and optimization. Most go into the direction of more readable code,
some aim at making the basic things faster, with good results as to performance
as you can see below.

New Optimization
----------------

- Constants in conditions of conditional expressions (``a if cond else d``),
  ``if``/``elif`` or ``while`` are now evaluated to ``true`` or ``false``
  directly. Before there would be temporary python object created from it which
  was then checked if it had a truth value.

  All of that is obviously overhead only. And it hurts the typically ``while
  1:`` infinite loop case badly.

- Do not generate code to catch ``BreakException`` or ``ContinueException``
  unless a ``break`` or ``continue`` statement being in a ``try: finally:``
  block inside that loop actually require this.

  Even while uncaught exceptions are cheap, it is still an improvement
  worthwhile and it clearly improves the readability for the normal case.

- The compiler more aggressively prepares tuples, lists and dicts from the
  source code as constants if their contents is "immutable" instead of building
  at run time. An example of a "mutable" tuple would be ``({},)`` which is not
  safe to share, and therefore will still be built at run time.

  For dictionaries and lists, copies will be made, under the assumption that
  copying a dictionary will always be faster, than making it from scratch.

- The parameter parsing code was dynamically building the tuple of argument
  names to check if an argument name was allowed by checking the equivalent of
  ``name in argument_names``. This was of course wasteful and now a pre-built
  constant is used for this, so it should be much faster to call functions with
  keyword arguments.

- There are new templates files and also actual templates now for the ``while``
  and ``for`` loop code generation. And I started work on having a template for
  assignments.

Cleanups
--------

- Do not generate code for the else of ``while`` and ``for`` loops if there is
  no such branch. This uncluttered the generated code somewhat.

- The indentation of the generated C++ was not very good and whitespace was
  often trailing, or e.g. a real tab was used instead of "\t". Some things
  didn't play well together here.

  Now much of the generated C++ code is much more readable and white space
  cleaner. For optimization to be done, the humans need to be able to read the
  generated code too. Mind you, the aim is not to produce usable C++, but on the
  other hand, it must be possible to understand it.

- To the same end of readability, the empty ``else {}`` branches are avoided for
  ``if``, ``while`` and ``for`` loops. While the C++ compiler can be expected to
  remove these, they seriously cluttered up things.

- The constant management code in ``Context`` was largely simplified. Now the
  code is using the ``Constant`` class to find its way around the problem that
  dicts, sets, etc. are not hashable, or that ``complex`` is not being ordered;
  this was necessary to allow deeply nested constants, but it is also a simpler
  code now.

- The C++ code generated for functions now has two entry points, one for Python
  calls (arguments as a list and dictionary for parsing) and one where this has
  happened successfully. In the future this should allow for faster function
  calls avoiding the building of argument tuples and dictionaries all-together.

- For every function there was a "traceback adder" which was only used in the
  C++ exception handling before exit to CPython to add to the traceback
  object. This was now in-lined, as it won't be shared ever.

Numbers
-------

python 2.6::

  Pystone(1.1) time for 50000 passes = 0.65
  This machine benchmarks at 76923.1 pystones/second

Nuitka 0.3.1::

  Pystone(1.1) time for 50000 passes = 0.41
  This machine benchmarks at 121951 pystones/second

This is 58% for 0.3.1, up from the 25% before. So it's getting somewhere. As
always you will find its latest version here.


Nuitka Release 0.3.0
====================

This release 0.3.0 is the first release to focus on performance. In the 0.2.x
series Nuitka achieved feature parity with CPython 2.6 and that was very
important, but now it is time to make it really useful.

Optimization has been one of the main points, although I was also a bit forward
looking to Python 2.7 language constructs. This release is the first where I
really started to measure things and removed the most important bottlenecks.

New Features
------------

- Added option to control ``--debug``. With this option the C++ debug
  information is present in the file, otherwise it is not. This will give much
  smaller ".so" and ".exe" files than before.

- Added option ``--no-optimization`` to disable all optimization. It enables C++
  asserts and compiles with less aggressive C++ compiler optimization, so it can
  be used for debugging purposes.

- Support for Python 2.7 set literals has been added.

Performance Enhancements
------------------------

- Fast global variables: Reads of global variables were fast already. This was
  due to a trick that is now also used to check them and to do a much quicker
  update if they are already set.

- Fast ``break``/``continue`` statements: To make sure these statements execute
  the finally handlers if inside a try, these used C++ exceptions that were
  caught by ``try``/``finally`` in ``while`` or ``for`` loops.

  This was very slow and had very bad performance. Now it is checked if this is
  at all necessary and then it's only done for the rare case where a
  ``break``/``continue`` really is inside the tried block. Otherwise it is now
  translated to a C++ ``break``/``continue`` which the C++ compiler handles more
  efficiently.

- Added ``unlikely()`` compiler hints to all errors handling cases to allow the
  C++ compiler to generate more efficient branch code.

- The for loop code was using an exception handler to make sure the iterated
  value was released, using ``PyObjectTemporary`` for that instead now, which
  should lead to better generated code.

- Using constant dictionaries and copy from them instead of building them at run
  time even when contents was constant.

New Tests
---------

- Merged some bits from the CPython 2.7 test suite that do not harm 2.6, but
  generally it's a lot due to some ``unittest`` module interface changes.

- Added CPython 2.7 tests ``test_dictcomps.py`` and ``test_dictviews.py`` which
  both pass when using Python 2.7.

- Added another benchmark extract from "PyStone" which uses a while loop with
  break.

Numbers
-------

python 2.6::

  Pystone(1.1) time for 50000 passes = 0.65
  This machine benchmarks at 76923.1 pystones/second

Nuitka 0.3.0::

  Pystone(1.1) time for 50000 passes = 0.52
  This machine benchmarks at 96153.8 pystones/second

That's a 25% speedup now and a good start clearly. It's not yet in the range of
where i want it to be, but there is always room for more. And the
``break``/``continue`` exception was an important performance regression fix.


Nuitka Release 0.2.4
====================

This release 0.2.4 is likely the last 0.2.x release, as it's the one that
achieved feature parity with CPython 2.6, which was the whole point of the
release series, so time to celebrate. I have stayed away (mostly) from any
optimization, so as to not be premature.

From now on speed optimization is going to be the focus though. Because right
now, frankly, there is not much of a point to use Nuitka yet, with only a minor
run time speed gain in trade for a long compile time. But hopefully we can
change that quickly now.

New Features
------------

- The use of exec in a local function now adds local variables to scope it is
  in.

- The same applies to ``from module_name import *`` which is now compiled
  correctly and adds variables to the local variables.

Bug Fixes
---------

- Raises ``UnboundLocalError`` when deleting a local variable with ``del``
  twice.

- Raises ``NameError`` when deleting a global variable with ``del`` twice.

- Read of to uninitialized closure variables gave ``NameError``, but
  ``UnboundLocalError`` is correct and raised now.

Cleanups
--------

- There is now a dedicated pass over the node tree right before code generation
  starts, so that some analysis can be done as late as that. Currently this is
  used for determining which functions should have a dictionary of locals.

- Checking the exported symbols list, fixed all the cases where a ``static`` was
  missing. This reduces the "module.so" sizes.

- With gcc the "visibility=hidden" is used to avoid exporting the helper
  classes. Also reduces the "module.so" sizes, because classes cannot be made
  static otherwise.

New Tests
---------

- Added "DoubleDeletions" to cover behaviour of ``del``. It seems that this is
  not part of the CPython test suite.

- The "OverflowFunctions" (those with dynamic local variables) now has an
  interesting test, exec on a local scope, effectively adding a local variable
  while a closure variable is still accessible, and a module variable too. This
  is also not in the CPython test suite.

- Restored the parts of the CPython test suite that did local star imports or
  exec to provide new variables. Previously these have been removed.

- Also "test_with.py" which covers PEP 343 has been reactivated, the with
  statement works as expected.


Nuitka Release 0.2.3
====================

This new release is marking a closing in on feature parity to CPython 2.6 which
is an important mile stone. Once this is reached, a "Nuitka 0.3.x" series will
strive for performance.

Bug Fixes
---------

- Generator functions no longer leak references when started, but not finished.

- Yield can in fact be used as an expression and returns values that the
  generator user ``send()`` to it.

Reduced Differences / New Features
----------------------------------

- Generator functions already worked quite fine, but now they have the
  ``throw()``, ``send()`` and ``close()`` methods.

- Yield is now an expression as is ought to be, it returns values put in by
  ``send()`` on the generator user.

- Support for extended slices:

  .. code-block:: python

     x = d[:42, ..., :24:, 24, 100]
     d[:42, ..., :24:, 24, 100] = "Strange"
     del d[:42, ..., :24:, 24, 100]

Tests Work
----------

- The "test_contextlib" is now working perfectly due to the generator functions
  having a correct ``throw()``. Added that test back, so context managers are
  now fully covered.

- Added a basic test for "overflow functions" has been added, these are the ones
  which have an unknown number of locals due to the use of language constructs
  ``exec`` or ``from bla import *`` on the function level. This one currently
  only highlights the failure to support it.

- Reverted removals of extended slice syntax from some parts of the CPython test
  suite.

Cleanups
--------

- The compiled generator types are using the new C++0x type safe enums feature.

- Resolved a circular dependency between ``TreeBuilding`` and
  ``TreeTransforming`` modules.


Nuitka Release 0.2.2
====================

This is some significant progress, a lot of important things were addressed.

Bug Fixes
---------

- Scope analysis is now done during the tree building instead of sometimes
  during code generation, this fixed a few issues that didn't show up in tests
  previously.

- Reference leaks of generator expressions that were not fishing, but then
  deleted are not more.

- Inlining of exec is more correct now.

- More accurate exception lines when iterator creation executes compiled code,
  e.g. in a for loop

- The list of base classes of a class was evaluated in the context of the class,
  now it is done in the context of the containing scope.

- The first iterated of a generator expression was evaluated in its own context,
  now it is done in the context of the containing scope.

Reduced Differences
-------------------

- With the enhanced scope analysis, ``UnboundLocalError`` is now correctly
  supported.

- Generator expressions (but not yet functions) have a ``throw()``, ``send()``
  and ``close()`` method.

- Exec can now write to local function namespace even if ``None`` is provided at
  run time.

- Relative imports inside packages are now correctly resolved at compile time
  when using ``--deep``.

Cleanups
--------

- The compiled function type got further enhanced and cleaned up.

- The compiled generator expression function type lead to a massive cleanup of
  the code for generator expressions.

- Cleaned up namespaces, was still using old names, or "Py*" which is reserved
  to core CPython.

- Overhaul of the code responsible for ``eval`` and ``exec``, it has been split,
  and it pushed the detection defaults to the C++ compiler which means, we can
  do it at run time or compile time, depending on circumstances.

- Made ``PyTemporaryObject`` safer to use, disabling copy constructor it should
  be also a relief to the C++ compiler if it doesn't have to eliminate all its
  uses.

- The way delayed work is handled in ``TreeBuilding`` step has been changed to
  use closured functions, should be more readable.

- Some more code templates have been created, making the code generation more
  readable in some parts. More to come.

New Features
------------

- As I start to consider announcing Nuitka, I moved the version logic so that
  the version can now be queried with ``--version``.

New Optimization
----------------

- Name lookups for ``None``, ``True`` and ``False`` and now always detected as
  constants, eliminating many useless module variable lookups.

New Tests
---------

- More complete test of generator expressions.

- Added test program for packages with relative imports inside the package.

- The built-in ``dir()`` in a function was not having fully deterministic output
  list, now it does.

Summary
-------

Overall, the amount of differences between CPython and Nuitka is heading towards
zero. Also most of the improvements done in this release were very
straightforward cleanups and not much work was required, mostly things are about
cleanups and then it becomes easily right. The new type for the compiled
generator expressions was simple to create, esp. as I could check what CPython
does in its source code.

For optimization purposes, I decided that generator expressions and generator
functions will be separate compiled types, as most of their behavior will not be
shared. I believe optimizing generator expressions to run well is an important
enough goal to warrant that they have their own implementation. Now that this is
done, I will repeat it with generator functions.

Generator functions already work quite fine, but like generator expressions did
before this release, they can leak references if not finished , and they don't
have the ``throw()`` method, which seems very important to the correct operation
of ``contextlib``. So I will introduce a decicated type for these too, possibly
in the next release.


Nuitka Release 0.2.1
====================

The march goes on, this is another minor release with a bunch of substantial
improvements:

Bug Fixes
---------

- Packages now also can be embedded with the ``--deep`` option too, before they
  could not be imported from the executable.

- In-lined exec with their own future statements leaked these to the surrounding
  code.

Reduced Differences
-------------------

- The future print function import is now supported too.

Cleanups
--------

- Independence of the compiled function type. When I started it was merely
  ``PyCFunction`` and then a copy of it patched at run time, using increasingly
  less code from CPython. Now it's nothing at all anymore.

- This lead to major cleanup of run time compiled function creation code, no
  more ``methoddefs``, ``PyCObject`` holding context, etc.

- PyLint was used to find the more important style issues and potential bugs,
  also helping to identify some dead code.

Summary
-------

The major difference now is the lack of a throw method for generator
functions. I will try to address that in a 0.2.2 release if possible. The plan
is that the 0.2.x series will complete these tasks, and 0.3 could aim at some
basic optimization finally.


Nuitka Release 0.2
==================

Good day, this is a major step ahead, improvements everywhere.

Bug fixes
---------

- Migrated the Python parser from the deprecated and problematic ``compiler``
  module to the ``ast`` module which fixes the ``d[a,] = b`` parser problem. A
  pity it was not available at the time I started, but the migration was
  relatively painless now.

- I found and fixed wrong encoding of binary data into C++ literals. Now Nuitka
  uses C++0x raw strings, and these problems are gone.

- The decoding of constants was done with the ``marshal`` module, but that
  appears to not deeply care enough about unicode encoding it seems. Using
  ``cPickle`` now, which seems less efficient, but is more correct.

- Another difference is gone: The ``continue`` and ``break`` inside loops do no
  longer prevent the execution of finally blocks inside the loop.

Organizational
--------------

- I now maintain the "README.txt" in org-mode, and intend to use it as the issue
  tracker, but I am still a beginner at that.

  .. admonition:: Update

     Turned out I never master it, and used ReStructured Text instead.

- There is a public git repository for you to track Nuitka releases. Make your
  changes and then ``git pull --rebase``. If you encounter conflicts in things
  you consider useful, please submit the patches and a pull offer. When you make
  your clones of Nuitka public, use ``nuitka-unofficial`` or not the name
  ``Nuitka`` at all.

- There is a now a `mailing list <http://nuitka.net/pages/mailinglist.html>`__
  available too.

Reduced Differences
-------------------

- Did you know you could write ``lambda : (yield something)`` and it gives you a
  lambda that creates a generator that produces that one value? Well, now Nuitka
  has support for lambda generator functions.

- The ``from __future__ import division`` statement works as expected now,
  leading to some newly passing CPython tests.

- Same for ``from __future__ import unicode_literals`` statement, these work as
  expected now, removing many differences in the CPython tests that use this
  already.

New Features
------------

- The ``Python`` binary provided and ``Nuitka.py`` are now capable of accepting
  parameters for the program executed, in order to make it even more of a
  drop-in replacement to ``python``.

- Inlining of ``exec`` statements with constant expressions. These are now
  compiled at compile time, not at run time anymore. I observed that an
  increasing number of CPython tests use exec to do things in isolation or to
  avoid warnings, and many more these tests will now be more effective. I intend
  to do the same with eval expressions too, probably in a minor release.

Summary
-------

So give it a whirl. I consider it to be substantially better than before, and
the list of differences to CPython is getting small enough, plus there is
already a fair bit of polish to it. Just watch out that it needs gcc-4.5 or
higher now.


Nuitka Release 0.1.1
====================

I just have just updated Nuitka to version 0.1.1 which is a bug fix release to
0.1, which corrects many of the small things:

- Updated the CPython test suite to 2.6.6rc and minimized much of existing
  differences in the course.

- Compiles standalone executable that includes modules (with --deep option), but
  packages are not yet included successfully.

- Reference leaks with exceptions are no more.

- sys.exc_info() works now mostly as expected (it's not a stack of exceptions).

- More readable generated code, better organisation of C++ template code.

- Restored debug option ``--g++-only``.

The biggest thing probably is the progress with exception tracebacks objects in
exception handlers, which were not there before (always ``None``). Having these
in place will make it much more compatible. Also with manually raised exceptions
and assertions, tracebacks will now be more correct to the line.

On a bad news, I discovered that the ``compiler`` module that I use to create
the AST from Python source code, is not only deprecated, but also broken. I
created the `CPython bug <http://bugs.python.org/issue9656>`__ about it,
basically it cannot distinguish some code of the form ``d[1,] = None`` from
``d[1] = None``. This will require a migration of the ``ast`` module, which
should not be too challenging, but will take some time.

I am aiming at it for a 0.2 release. Generating wrong code (Nuitka sees ``d[1] =
None`` in both cases) is a show blocker and needs a solution.

So, yeah. It's better, it's there, but still experimental. You will find its
latest version here. Please try it out and let me know what you think in the
comments section.


Nuitka Release 0.1 (Releasing Nuitka to the World)
==================================================

Obviously this is very exciting step for me. I am releasing Nuitka
today. Finally. For a long time I knew I would, but actually doing it, is a
different beast. Reaching my goals for release turned out to be less far away
than I hope, so instead of end of August, I can already release it now.

Currently it's not more than 4% faster than CPython. No surprise there, if all
you did, is removing the bytecode interpretation so far. It's not impressive at
all. It's not even a reason to use it. But it's also only a start. Clearly, once
I get into optimizing the code generation of Nuitka, it will only get better,
and then probably in sometimes dramatic steps. But I see this as a long term
goal.

I want to have infrastructure in the code place, before doing lots of possible
optimization that just make Nuitka unmaintainable. And I will want to have a
look at what others did so far in the domain of type inference and how to apply
that for my project.

I look forward to the reactions about getting this far. The supported language
volume is amazing, and I have a set of nice tricks used. For example the way
generator functions are done is a clever hack.

Where to go from here? Well, I guess, I am going to judge it by the feedback I
receive. I personally see "constant propagation" as a laudable first low hanging
fruit, that could be solved.

Consider this readable code on the module level:

.. code-block:: python

    meters_per_nautical_mile = 1852

    def convertMetersToNauticalMiles(meters):
        return meters / meters_per_nautical_mile
    def convertNauticalMilesToMeters(miles):
        return miles * meters_per_nautical_mile

Now imagine you are using this very frequently in code. Quickly you determine
that the following will be much faster:

.. code-block:: python

    def convertMetersToNauticalMiles(meters):
        return meters / 1852
    def convertNauticalMilesToMeters(miles):
        return miles * 1852

Still good? Well, probably next step you are going to in-line the function calls
entirely. For optimization, you are making your code less readable. I do not all
appreciate that. My first goal is there to make the more readable code perform
as well or better as the less readable variant.

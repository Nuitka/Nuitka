Nuitka Release 0.3.21 (Draft)
=============================

This time there are some really major cleanups, all heading towards enabling value
propagation inside Nuitka.

Bug fixes
---------

- The builtin "next" could causes a program crash when iterating past the end of an
  iterator. Issue#??. Fixed in 0.3.20.1 already.

New Features
------------

- None

New Optimizations
-----------------

- None

Organizational
--------------

- Changed the Scons build file database to reside in the build directory as opposed to the
  current directory, not polluting it anymore. Thanks for the patch go to Michael H Kent,
  very much appreciated.

- The "--experimental" option is no longer available outside of checkouts of git, and on
  there not on stable branches. It only pollutes "--help" output otherwise as stable
  releases have no experimental code options.

Cleanups
--------

- Changed complex assignments, i.e. assignments with multiple targets to such using a
  temporary variable and multiple simple assignments instead.

  .. code-block:: python

     a = b = c

  .. code-block:: python

     _tmp = c
     b = _tmp
     a = _tmp

  In CPython, when one assignment raises an exception, the whole thing is aborted, so the
  complexity of having multiple targets is no more needed, now that we have temporary
  variables in a block.

  All that was really needed, was to evaluate the complete source expression only once,
  but that made code generation contain ugly loops that are no more needed.

- Changed unpacking assignments to use temporary variables. Code like this:

  .. code-block:: python

     a, b = c

  Is handled more like this:

  .. code-block:: python

     _tmp_iter = iter(c)
     _tmp1 = next( _tmp_iter )
     _tmp2 = next( _tmp_iter )
     if not finished( _tmp_iter ):
         raise ValueError( "too many values to unpack" )
     a = _tmp1
     b = _tmp2

  In reality, not really "next" is used, as it wouldn't raise the correct exception for
  unpacking, and the "finished" check is more condensed.

  Generally this cleanup means that the "AssignTargetTuple" and associated code generation
  could be removed, and now the value propagation needs to optimize these "next" and
  "iter" calls away where possible. At this time, this is not done yet.

New Tests
---------

- Added test to cover order of calls for complex assignments that unpack, to see that they
  make a fresh iterator for each part of a complex assignment.

- Added test that unpacks in an exception catch. It worked, due to the generic handling of
  assignment targets by Nuitka, and I didn't even know it can be done, example:

  .. code-block:: python

     try:
         raise ValueError(1,2)
     except ValueError as (a,b):
         print "Unpacking caught exception and unpacked", a, b

  Will assign a=1, b=2.


Summary
-------

This release is not complete yet.


Nuitka Release 0.3.20
=====================

This time there are a few bug fixes and some really major cleanups, lots of new
optimizations and preparations for more. And then there is a new compiler clang and a new
platform supported. MacOS X appears to work mostly, thanks for the patches from Pete Hunt.

Bug fixes
---------

- The use of a local variable name as an expression was not covered and lead to a compiler
  crash. Totally amazing, but true, nothing in the test suite of CPython covered
  this. Issue#30. Fixed in release 0.3.19.1 already.

- The use of a closure variable name as an expression was not covered as well. And in this
  case corrupted the reference count. Issue#31. Fixed in release 0.3.19.1 already.

- The "from x import \*" attempted to respect "__all__" but failed to do
  so. Issue#32. Fixed in release 0.3.19.2 already.

- The "from x import \*" didn't give a "SyntaxError" when used on Python3. Fixed in release
  0.3.19.2 already.

- The syntax error messages for "global for function argument name" and "duplicate function
  argument name" are now identical as well.

- Parameter values of generator function could cause compilation errors when used in the
  closure of list contractions. Fixed.

New Features
------------

- Added support for disabling the console for Windows binaries. Thanks for the patch go to
  Michael H Kent.

- Enhanced Python3 support for syntax errors, these are now also compatible.

- Support for MacOS X was added.

- Support for using the "clang" compiler was added, it can be enforced via "--clang"
  option. Currently this option is mainly intended to allow testing the "MacOS X" support
  as good as possible under Linux.

New Optimizations
-----------------

- Enhanced all optimizations that previously worked on "constants" to work on "compile
  time constants" instead. A "compile time constant" can currently also be any form of a
  builtin name or exception reference. It is intended to expand this in the future.

- Added support for builtins "bin", "oct", and "hex", which also can be computed at
  compile time, if their arguments are compile time constant.

- Added support for the "iter" builtin in both forms, one and two arguments. These cannot
  be computed at compile time, but now will execute faster.

- Added support for the "next" builtin, also in its both forms, one and two
  arguments. These also cannot be computed at compile time, but now will execute faster as
  well.

- Added support the the "open" builtin in all its form. We intend for future releases to
  be able to track file opens for including them into the executable if data files.

- Optimize the "__debug__" builtin constant as well. It cannot be assigned, yet code can
  determine a mode of operation from it, and apparently some code does. When compiling the
  mode is decided.

- Optimize the "Ellipsis" builtin constant as well. It falls in the same category as
  "True", "False", "None", i.e. names of builtin constants that a singletons.

- Added support for anonymous builtin references, i.e. builtins which have names that are
  not normally accessible. An example is "type(None)" which is not accessible from
  anywhere. Other examples of such names are "compiled_method_or_function". Having these
  as represented internally, and flagged as "compile time constants", allows the compiler
  to make more compile time optimizations and to generate more efficient C++ code for it
  that won't e.g. call the "type" builtin with "None" as an argument.

- All builtin names used in the program are now converted to "builtin name references" in
  a first step. Unsupported builtins like e.g. "zip", for which Nuitka has no
  own code or understanding yet, remained as "module variables", which made access to them
  slow, and difficult to recognize.

- Added optimization for module attributes "__file__", "__doc__" and "__package__" if they
  are read only. It's the same as "__name__".

- Added optimization for slices and subscripts of "compile time constant" values. These
  will play a more important role, once value propagation makes them more frequent.

Organizational
--------------

- Created a "change log" from the previous release announcements. It's as ReStructured
  Text and converted to PDF for the release as well, but I chose not to include that in
  Debian, because it's so easy to generate the PDF on that yourself.

- The posting of release announcements is now prepared by a script that converts the
  ReStructured Text to HTML and adds it to Wordpress as a draft posting or updates it,
  until it's release time. Simple, sweet and elegant.

Cleanups
--------

- Split out the "nuitka.nodes.Nodes" module into many topic nodes, so that there are now
  "nuitka.nodes.BoolNodes" or "nuitka.nodes.LoopNodes" to host nodes of similar kinds, so
  that it is now cleaner.

- Split "del" statements into their own node kind, and use much simpler node structures
  for them. The following blocks are absolutely the same:

  .. code-block:: python

     del a, b.c, d

  .. code-block:: python

     del a
     del b.c
     del d

  So that's now represented in the node tree. And even more complex looking cases, like
  this one, also the same:

  .. code-block:: python

     del a, (b.c, d)

  This one gives a different parse tree, but the same bytecode. And so Nuitka need no
  longer concern itself with this at all, and can remove the tuple from the parse tree
  immediately. That makes them easy to handle. As you may have noted already, it also
  means, there is no way to enforce that two things are deleted or none at all.

- Turned the function and class builder statements into mere assignment statements, where
  defaults and base classes are handled by wrapping expressions. Previously they are also
  kind of assignment statements too, which is not needed. Now they were reduced to only
  handle the "bases" for classes and the "defaults" for functions and make optional.

- Refactored the decorator handling to the tree building stage, presenting them as
  function calls on "function body expression" or class body expression".

  This allowed to remove the special code for decorators from code generation and C++
  templates, making decorations easy subjects for future optimizations, as they
  practically are now just function calls.

  .. code-block:: python

     @some_classdecorator
     class C:
         @staticmethod
         def f():
             pass

  It's just a different form of writing things. Nothing requires the implementation of
  decorators, it's just functions calls with function bodies before the assignment.

  The following is only similar:

  .. code-block:: python

     class C:
         def f():
             pass

         f = staticmethod( f )

     C = some_classdecorator( C )

  It's only similar, because the assignment to an intermediate value of "C" and "f" is not
  done, and should an exception be raised by the decoration, that name could persist. For
  Nuitka, the function and class body, before having a name, are an expression, and so can
  of course be passed to decorators already.

- The in-place assignments statements are now handled using temporary variable blocks

  Adding support for scoped temporary variables and references to them, it was possible to
  re-formulate in-place assignments expressions as normal lookups, in-place operation call
  and then assignment statement. This allowed to remove static templates and will yield
  even better generated code in the future.

- The for loop used to have has a "source" expression as child, and the iterator over it
  was only taken at the code generation level, so that step was therefore invisible to
  optimizations. Moved it to tree building stage instead, where optimizations can work on
  it then.

- Tree building now generally allows statement sequences to be "None" everywhere, and pass
  statements are immediately eliminated from them immediately. Empty statement sequences
  are now forbidden to exist.

- Moved the optimization for "__name__" to compute node of variable references, where it
  doesn't need anything complex to replace with the constant value if it's only read.

- Added new bases classes and mix-in classes dedicated to expressions, giving a place for
  some defaults.

- Made the builtin code more reusable.

New Tests
---------

- Added some more diagnostic tests about complex assignment and "del" statements.

- Added syntax test for star import on function level, that should fail on Python3.

- Added syntax test for duplicate argument name.

- Added syntax test for global on a function argument name.

Summary
-------

The decorator and building changes, the assignment changes, and the node cleanups are all
very important progress for the type inference work, because they remove special casing
the that previously would have been required. Lambdas and functions now really are the
same thing right after tree building. The in-place assignments are now merely done using
standard assignment code, the built functions and classes are now assigned to names in
assignment statements, much *more* consistency there.

Yet, even more work will be needed in the same direction. There may e.g. be work required
to cover "with" statements as well. And assignments should never be any more complex than
unpacking from a temporary variable.

For this release, there is only minimal progress on the Python3 front, despite the syntax
support, which is only miniscule progress. The remaining tasks appear all more or less
difficult work that I don't want to touch now.

But overall, it's fantastic progress that was made. There are still remaining steps, but I
believe, we can foresee that a release may be done that finally actually does type
inference and becomes the effective Python compiler this project is all about.


Nuitka Release 0.3.19
=====================

This time there are a few bug fixes, major cleanups, more Python3 support, and even new
features. A lot things in this are justifying a new release.

Bug fixes
---------

- The man pages of "nuitka" and "nuitka-python" had no special layout for the option
  groups and broken whitespace for "--recurse-to" option. Also "--g++-only" was only
  partially bold. Released as 0.3.18.1 hotfix already.

- The command line length improvement we made to Scons for Windows was not portable to
  Python2.6. Released as 0.3.18.2 hotfix already.

- Code to detect already considered packages detection was not portable to Windows, for
  one case, there was still a use of "/" instead of using a "joinpath" call. Released as
  0.3.18.3 already.

- A call to the range built-in with no arguments would crash the compiler, see
  Issue#29. Released as 0.3.18.4 already.

- Compatibility Fix: When rich comparison operators returned false value other "False",
  for comparison chains, these would not be used, but "False" instead, see .

- The support for "__import__" didn't cover keyword arguments, these were simply
  ignored. See Issue#28. Fixed, but no warning is given yet.

New Features
------------

- A new option has been added, one can now specify "--recurse-directory" and Nuitka will
  attempt to embed these modules even if not obviously imported. This is not yet working
  perfect yet, but will receive future improvements.

- Added support for the "exec" built-in of Python3, this enables us to run one more basic
  test, "GlobalStatement.py" with Python3. The test "ExecEval.py" nearly works now.

New Optimizations
-----------------

- The no arguments "range()" call now optimized into the static CPython exception it
  raises.

- Parts of comparison chains with constant arguments are now optimized away.

Cleanups
--------

- Simplified the "CPythonExpressionComparison" node, it now always has only 2 operands.

  If there are more, the so called "comparison chain", it's done via "and" with
  assignments to temporary variables, which are expressed by a new node type
  "CPythonExpressionTempVariableRef". This allowed to remove "expression_temps" from C++
  code templates and generation, reducing the overall complexity.

- When executing a module ("--execute" but not "--exe"), no longer does Nuitka import it
  into itself, instead a new interpreter is launched with a fresh environment.

- The calls to the variadic "MAKE_TUPLE" were replaced with calls the "MAKE_TUPLExx"
  (where "xx" is the number of arguments), that are generated on a as-needed basis. This
  gives more readable code, because no "EVAL_ORDERED_xx" is needed at call site anymore.

- Many node classes have moved to new modules in "nuitka.nodes" and grouped by theme. That
  should make them more accessible.

- The choosing of the debug python has moved from Scons to Nuitka itself. That way it can
  respect the "sys.abiflags" and works with Python3.

- The replacing of ".py" in filenames was made more robust. No longer is "str.replace"
  used, but instead proper means to assure that having ".py" as other parts of the
  filenames won't be a trouble.

- Module recursion was changed into its own module, instead of being hidden in the
  optimization that considers import statements.

- As always, some PyLint work, and some minor TODOs were solved.

Organizational
--------------

- Added more information to the "Developer Manual", e.g. documenting the tree changes for
  "assert" to become a conditional statement with a raise statement, etc.

- The Debian package is as of this version verified to be installable and functional on to
  Ubuntu Natty, Maverick, Oneiric, and Precise.

- Added support to specify the binary under test with a "NUITKA" environment, so the test
  framework can run with installed version of Nuitka too.

- Made sure the test runners work under Windows as well. Required making them more
  portable. And a workaround for "os.execl" not propagating exit codes under Windows. See
  Issue#26 for more information.

- For windows target the MinGW library is now linked statically. That means there is no
  requirement for MinGW to be in the "PATH" or even installed to execute the binary.

New Tests
---------

- The "basic", "programs", "syntax", and "reflected" were made executable under
  Windows. Occasionally this meant to make the test runners more portable, or to work
  around limitations.

- Added test to cover return values of rich comparisons in comparison chains, and order of
  argument evaluation for comparison chains.

- The "Referencing.py" test was made portable to Python3.

- Cover no arguments "range()" exception as well.

- Added test to demonstrate that "--recurse-directory" actually works. This is using an
  "__import__" that cannot be predicted at run time (yet).

- The created source package is now tested on pbuilder chroots to be installable and
  capable of the basic tests, in addition to the full tests during package build time on
  these chroots. This will make sure, that Nuitka works fine on Ubuntu Natty and doesn't
  break without notice.

Summary
-------

This releases contains many changes. The "temporary variable ref" and "assignment
expression" work is ground breaking. I foresee that it will lead to even more
simplifications of code generation in the future, when e.g. in-place assignments can be
reduced to assignments to temporary variables and conditional statements.

While there were many improvements related to Windows support and fixing portability bugs,
or the Debian package, the real focus is the optimization work, which will ultimately end
with "value propagation" working.

These are the real focus. The old comparison chain handling was a big wart. Working, but
no way understood by any form of analysis in Nuitka. Now they have a structure which makes
their code generation based on semantics and allows for future optimizations to see
through them.

Going down this route is an important preparatory step. And there will be more work like
this needed. Consider e.g. handling of in-place assignments. With an "assignment
expression" to a "temporary variable ref", these become the same as user code using such a
variable. There will be more of these to find.

So, that is where the focus is. The release now was mostly aiming at getting involved
fixes out. The bug fixed by comparison chain reworking, and the "__import__" related one,
were not suitable for hotfix releases, so that is why the 0.3.19 release had to occur
now. But with plugin support, with this comparison chain cleanup, with improved Python3
support, and so on, there was plenty of good stuff already, also worth to get out.


Nuitka Release 0.3.18
=====================

This is to inform you about the new stable release of Nuitka. This time there are a few
bug fixes, and the important step that triggered the release: Nuitka has entered Debian
Unstable. So you if want, you will get stable Nuitka releases from now on via "apt-get
install nuitka".

The release cycle was too short to have much focus. It merely includes fixes, which were
available as hotfixes, and some additional optimizations and node tree cleanups, as well
as source cleanups. But not much else.

Bug fixes
---------

- Conditional statements with both branches empty were not optimized away in all cases,
  triggering an assertion of code generation. Issue#16. Released as 0.3.17a hotfix
  already.

- Nuitka was considering directories to contain packages that had no "__init__.py" which
  could lead to errors when it couldn't find the package later in the compilation
  process. Released as 0.3.17a hotfix already.

- When providing "locals()" to "exec" statements, this was not making the "locals()"
  writable. The logic to detect the case that default value is used (None) and be
  pessimistic about it, didn't consider the actual value "locals()". Released as 0.3.17b
  hotfix already.

- Compatibility Fix: When no defaults are given, CPython uses "None" for
  "func.func_defaults", but Nuitka had been using "None".

New Optimizations
-----------------

- If the condition of assert statements can be predicted, these are now optimized in a
  static raise or removed.

- For builtin name references, there is now dedicated code to look them up, that doesn't
  check the module level at all. Currently these are used in only a few cases though.

- Cleaner code is generated for the simple case of "print" statements. This is not only
  faster code, it's also more readable.

Cleanups
--------

- Removed the "CPythonStatementAssert" node.

  It's not needed, instead at tree building, assert statements are converted to
  conditional statements with the asserted condition result inverted and a raise statement
  with "AssertionError" and the assertion argument.

  This allowed to remove code and complexity from the subsequent stetps of Nuitka, and
  enabled existing optimizations to work on assert statements as well.

- Moved builtin exception names and builtin names to a new module "nuitka.Builtins"
  instead of having in other places. This was previously a bit spread-out and misplaced.

- Added cumulative "tags" to node classes for use in checks. Use it annotate which node
  kinds to visit in e.g. per scope finalization steps. That avoids kinds and class checks.

- Enhanced the "visitor" interface to provide more kinds of callbacks, enhanced the way
  "each scope" visiting is achieved by generalizing is as "child has not tag
  'closure_taker'" and that for every "node that has tag 'closure_taker'".

- Moved "SyntaxHighlighting" module to "nuitka.gui" package where it belongs.

- More white listing work for imports. As recursion is now the default, and leads to
  warnings for non-existent modules, the CPython tests gave a lot of good candidates for
  import errors that should be white listed.

- Consistently use "nuitka" in test scripts, as there isn't a "Nuitka.py" on all
  platforms. The later is scheduled for removal.

- New node for builtin name loopups, which allowed to remove tricks played with adding
  module variable lookups for "staticmethod" when adding them for "__new__" or module
  variable lookups for "str" when predicting the result of "type( 'a' )", which was
  unlikely to cause a problem, but an important TODO item still.

Organizational
--------------

- The "Download" page is now finally updated for releases automatically. This closes
  Issue#7 completely. Up to this release, I had to manually edit that page, but I now
  mastered the art of upload via XMLRCP and a Python script, so that I don't loose as much
  time with editing, checking it, etc.

- Added a "Developer Manual" to the release. It's incomplete, but it details some of the
  existing stuff, coding rules, plans for "type inference", etc.

- The Debian package is backportable to Ubuntu Natty, Maverick, Oneiric, I expect to make
  a separate announcement with links to packages.

- Made sure the test runners worth with bare "python2.6" as well.

New Tests
---------

- Added some tests intended for type inference development.

Summary
-------

This releases contains not as much changes as others, mostly because it's the intended
base for a Debian upload.

The "exec" fix was detected by continued work on the branch
"feature/minimize_CPython26_tests_diff" branch, but that work is now complete.

It is being made pretty (many git rebase iterations) with lots of Issues being added to
the bug tracker and referenced for each change. The intention is to have a clean commits
repository with the changed made.

But of course, the real excitement is the "type inference" work. It will give a huge boost
to Nuitka. With this in place, new benchmarks may make sense. I am working on getting it
off the ground, but also to make us more efficient.

So when I learn something. e.g. "assert" is not special, I apply it to the "develop"
branch immediately, to keep the differences as small as possible, and to immediately
benefit from such improvements.


Nuitka Release 0.3.17
=====================

This is to inform you about the new stable release of Nuitka. This time there are a few
bug fixes, lots of very important organisational work, and yet again improved
compatibility and cleanups. Also huge is the advance in making "--deep" go away and making
the recursion of Nuitka controllable, which means a lot for scalability of projects that
use a lot of packages that use other packages, because now you can choose which ones to
embed and which ones one.

The release cycle had a focus on improving the quality of the test scripts, the packaging,
and generally to prepare the work on "type inference" in a new feature branch.

I have also continued to work towards CPython3.2 compatibility, and this version, while
not there, supports Python3 with a large subset of the basic tests programs running fine
(of course via "2to3" conversion) without trouble. There is still work to do, exceptions
don't seem to work fully yet, parameter parsing seems to have changed, etc. but it seems
that CPython3.2 is going to work one day.

And there has been a lot of effort, to address the Debian packaging to be cleaner and more
complete, addressing issues that prevented it from entering the Debian repository.

Bug fixes
---------

- Fixed the handling of modules and packages of the same name, but with different
  casing. Problem showed under Windows only. Released as 0.3.16a hotfix already.

- Fixed an error where the command line length of Windows was exceeded when many modules
  were embedded, Christopher Tott provided a fix for it. Released as 0.3.16a hotfix
  already.

- Fix, avoid to introduce new variables for where built-in exception references are
  sufficient. Released as 0.3.16b hotfix already.

- Fix, add the missing "staticmethod" decorator to "__new__" methods before resolving the
  scopes of variables, this avoids the use of that variable before it was assigned a
  scope. Released as 0.3.16b hotfix already.

New Features
------------

- Enhanced compatibility again, provide enough "co_varnames" in the code objects, so that
  slicing them up to "code_object.co_argcount" will work. They are needed by "inspect"
  module and might be used by some decorators as well.

- New options to control the recursion:

  --recurse-none" (do not warn about not-done recursions)
  --recurse-all (recurse to all otherwise warned modules)
  --recurse-to (confirm to recurse to those modules)
  --recurse-not-to (confirm to not recurse to those modules)

New Optimizations
-----------------

- The optimization of constant conditional expressions was not done yet. Added this
  missing constant propagation case.

- Eliminate near empty statement sequences (only contain a pass statement) in more places,
  giving a cleaner node structure for many constructs.

- Use the pickle "protocol 2" on CPython2 except for "unicode" strings where it does not
  work well. It gives a more compressed and binary representation, that is generally more
  efficient to un-stream as well. Also use the cPickle protocol, the use of "pickle" was
  not really necessary anymore.

Organizational
--------------

- Added a "Developer Manual" to the release. It's incomplete, but it details some of the
  existing stuff, coding rules, plans for "type inference", etc.

- Improved the "--help" output to use "metavar" where applicable. This makes it more
  readable for some options.

- Instead of error message, give help output when no module/program file name was
  given. This should make Nuitka help more convenient.

- Consistently use "#!/usr/bin/env python" for all scripts, this was previously only done
  for some of them.

- Ported the PyLint check script to Python as well, enhancing it on the way to check the
  exit code, and to only output changes things, as well as making the output of warnings
  for "TODO" items optional.

- All scripts used for testing, PyLint checking, etc. now work with Python3 as well. Most
  useful on Arch Linux, where it's also already the default for "Python".

- The help output of Nuitka was polished a lot more. It is now more readable and uses
  option groups to combine related options together.

- Make the tests run without any dependence on "PATH" to contain the executables of
  Nuitka. This should make it easier to use.

- Add license texts to 3rd party file that were missing them, apply "licensecheck" results
  to cleanup Nuitka. Also removed own copyright statement from inline copy of Scons, it
  had been added by accident only.

- Release the tests that I own as well as the Debian packaging I created under "Apache
  License 2.0" which is very liberal, meaning every project should be able to use it.

- Don't require copyright assignment for contributions anymore, instead only "Apache
  License 2.0", the future Nuitka license, so that the code won't be a problem when
  changing the license of all of Nuitka to that license.

- Give contributors listed in the user manual an exception to the GPL terms until Nuitka
  is licensed under "Apache License 2.0" as well.

- Added an "--experimental" option which can be used to control experimental features,
  like the one currently being added on "feature/ctypes_annotation", where "type
  inference" is currently only activated when that option is given. For this stable
  release, it does nothing.

- Check the static C++ files of Nuitka with "cppcheck" as well. Didn't find anything.

- Arch Linux packages have been contributed, these are linked for download, but the stable
  package may lag behind a bit.

Cleanups
--------

- Changed "not" boolean operation to become a normal operator. Changed "and" and "or"
  boolean operators to a new base class, and making their interface more similar to that
  of operations.

- Added cumulative "tags" to node classes for use in checks. Use it annotate which node
  kinds to visit in e.g. per scope finalization steps. That avoids kinds and class checks.

- Enhanced the "visitor" interface to provide more kinds of callbacks, enhanced the way
  "each scope" visiting is achieved by generalizing is as "child has not tag
  'closure_taker'" and that for every "node that has tag 'closure_taker'".

- Moved "SyntaxHighlighting" module to "nuitka.gui" package where it belongs.

- More white listing work for imports. As recursion is now the default, and leads to
  warnings for non-existent modules, the CPython tests gave a lot of good candidates for
  import errors that should be white listed.

- Consistently use "nuitka" in test scripts, as there isn't a "Nuitka.py" on all
  platforms. The later is scheduled for removal.

- Some more PyLint cleanups.

New Tests
---------

- Make sure the basic tests pass with CPython or else fail the test. This is to prevent
  false positives, where a test passes, but only because it fails in CPython early on and
  then does so with Nuitka too. For the syntax tests we make sure they fail.

- The basic tests can now be run with "PYTHON=python3.2" and use "2to3" conversion in that
  case. Also the currently not passing tests are not run, so the passing tests continue to
  do so, with this run from the release test script "check-release".

- Include the syntax tests in release tests as well.

- Changed many existing tests so that they can run under CPython3 too. Of course this is
  via "2to3" conversion.

- Don't fail if the CPython test suites are not there.

  Currently they remain largely unpublished, and as such are mostly only available to me
  (exception, "feature/minimize_CPython26_tests_diff" branch references the CPython2.6
  tests repository, but that remains work in progress).

- For the compile itself test: Make the presence of the Scons inline copy optional, the
  Debian package doesn't contain it.

- Also make it more portable, so it runs under Windows too, and allow to choose the Python
  version to test. Check this test with both CPython2.6 and CPython2.7 not only the
  default Python.

- Before releasing, test that the created Debian package builds fine in a minimal Debian
  "unstable" chroot, and passes all the tests included in the package ("basics", "syntax",
  "programs", "reflected"). Also many other Debian packaging improvements.

Summary
-------

The "git flow" was used again in this release cycle and proved to be useful not only for
hotfix, but also for creating the branch "feature/ctypes_annotation" and rebasing it often
while things are still flowing.

The few hotfixes didn't require a new release, but the many organizational improvements
and the new features did warrant the new release, because of e.g. the much better test
handling in this release and the improved recursion control.

The work on Python3 support has slowed down a bit. I mostly only added some bits for
compatibility, but generally it has slowed down. I wanted to make sure it doesn't regress
by accident, so running with CPython3.2 is now part of the normal release tests.

What's still missing is more "hg" completeness. Only the "co_varnames" work for "inspect"
was going in that direction, and this has slowed down. It was more important to make
Nuitka's recursion more accessible with the new options, so that was done first.

And of course, the real excitement is the the "type inference" work. It will give a huge
boost to Nuitka, and I am happy that it seems to go well. With this in place, new
benchmarks may make sense. I am working on getting it off the ground, so other people can
work on it too. My idea of "ctypes" native calls may become true sooner than expected. To
support that, I would like to add more tools to make sure we discover changes earlier on,
checking the XML representations of tests to discover improvements and regressions more
clearly.



Nuitka Release 0.3.16
=====================

This time there are many bug fixes, some important scalability work, and again improved
compatibility and cleanups.

The release cycle had a focus on fixing the bug reports I received. I have also continued
to look at CPython3 compatibility, and this is the first version to support Python3
somewhat, at least some of the basic tests programs run (of course via "2to3" conversion)
without trouble. I don't know when, but it seems that it's going to work one day.

Also there has an effort to make the Debian packaging cleaner, addressing all kinds of
small issues that prevented it from entering the Debian repository. It's still not there,
but it's making progress.

Bug fixes
---------

- Fixed a packaging problem for Linux and x64 platform, the new "swapFiber.S" file for the
  fiber management was not included. Released as 0.3.15a hotfix already.

- Fixed an error where optimization was performed on removed unreachable code, which lead
  to an error. Released as 0.3.15b hotfix already.

- Fixed an issue with "__import__" and recursion not happening in any case, because when
  it did, it failed due to not being ported to new internal APIs. Released as 0.3.15c
  hotfix already.

- Fixed "eval()" and "locals()" to be supported in generator expressions and contractions
  too. Released as 0.3.15d hotfix already.

- Fixed the Windows batch files "nuitka.bat" and "nuitka-python.bat" to not output the
  "rem" statements with the copyright header. Released as 0.3.15d hotfix already.

- Fixed re-raise with "raise", but without a current exception set. Released as 0.3.15e
  hotfix already.

- Fixed "vars()" call on the module level, needs to be treated as "globals()". Released as
  0.3.15e hotfix already.

- Fix handling of broken new lines in source files. Read the source code in "universal
  line ending mode". Released as 0.3.15f hotfix already.

- Fixed handling of constant module attribute "__name__" being replaced. Don't replace
  local variables of the same name too. Released as 0.3.15g hotfix already.

- Fixed assigning to "True", "False" or "None". There was this old TODO, and some code has
  compatibility craft that does it. Released as 0.3.15g hotfix already.

- Fix constant dictionaries not always being recognized as shared. Released as 0.3.15g
  hotfix already.

- Fix generator function objects to not require a return frame to exist. In finalize
  cleanup it may not.

- Fixed non-execution of cleanup codes that e.g. flush "sys.stdout", by adding
  "Py_Finalize()".

- Fix "throw()" method of generator expression objects to not check arguments properly.

- Fix missing fallback to subscript operations for slicing with non-indexable objects.

- Fix, in-place subscript operations could fail to apply the update, if the intermediate
  object was e.g. a list and the handle just not changed by the operation, but e.g. the
  length did.

- Fix, the future spec was not properly preserving the future division flag.

New Optimizations
-----------------

- The optimization scales now much better, because per-module optimizations only require
  the module to be reconsidered, but not all modules all the time. With many modules
  recursed into, this makes a huge difference in compilation time.

- The creation of dictionaries from constants is now also optimized.

New Features
------------

- As a new feature functions now have the "func_defaults" and "__defaults__" attribute. It
  works only well for non-nested parameters and is not yet fully integrated into the
  parameter parsing. This improves the compatibility somewhat already though.

- The names "True", "False" and "None" are now converted to constants only when they are
  read-only module variables.

- The "PYTHONPATH" variable is now cleared when immediately executing a compiled binary
  unless "--execute-with-pythonpath" is given, in which case it is preserved. This allows
  to make sure that a binary is in fact containing everything required.

Organizational
--------------

- The help output of Nuitka was polished a lot more. It is now more readable and uses
  option groups to combine related options together.

- The inline copy of Scons is not checked with PyLint anymore. We of course don't care.

- Program tests are no longer executed in the program directory, so failed module
  inclusions become immediately obvious.

- The basic tests can now be run with "PYTHON=python3.2" and use "2to3" conversion in that
  case.

Cleanups
--------

- Moved "tags" to a separate module, make optimizations emit only documented tags, checked
  against the list of allowed ones.

- The Debian package has seen lots of improvements, to make it "lintian clean", even in
  pedantic mode. The homepage of Nuitka is listed, a watch file can check for new
  releases, the git repository and the gitweb are referenced, etc.

- Use "os.path.join" in more of the test code to achieve more Windows portability for them.

- Some more PyLint cleanups.

New Tests
---------

- There is now a "Crasher" test, for tests that crashed Nuitka previously.

- Added a program test where the imported module does a "sys.exit()" and make sure it
  really doesn't continue after the "SystemExit" exception that creates.

- Cover the type of "__builtins__" in the main program and in imported modules in tests
  too. It's funny and differs between module and dict in CPython2.

- Cover a final print without newline in the test. Should still receive a newline, which
  only happens when "Py_Finalize()" is called.

- Added test with functions that makes a "raise" without an exception set.

- Cover the calling of "vars()" on module level too.

- Cover the use of eval in contractions and generator expressions too.

- Cover "func_defaults" and "__default__" attributes for a function too.

- Added test function with two "raise" in an exception handler, so that one becomes dead
  code and removed without the crash.

Summary
-------

The "git flow" was really great in this release cycle. There were many hotfix releases
being made, so that the bugs could be addressed immediately without requiring the overhead
of a full release. I believe that this makes Nuitka clearly one of the best supported
projects.

This quick turn-around also encourages people to report more bugs, which is only good. And
the structure is there to hold it. Of course, the many bug fixes meant that there is not
as much new development, but that is not the priority, correctness is.

The work on Python3 is a bit strange. I don't need Python3 at all. I also believe it is
that evil project to remove cruft from the Python core and make developers of all relevant
Python software, add compatibility cruft to their software instead. Yet, I can't really
stop to work on it. It has that appeal of small fixups here and there, and then something
else works too.

Python3 work is like when I was first struggling with Nuitka to pass the CPython2 unit
tests for a first time. It's fun. And then it finds real actual bugs that apply to
CPython2 too. Not doing "Py_Finalize" (but having to), the slice operations shortcomings,
the bug of subscript in-place, and so on. There is likely more things hidden, and the
early "Python3" is supported, the more benefit from increased test covered.

What's missing is more "hg" completeness. I think only the "raise" without exception set
and the "func_defaults" issue were going into its direction, but it won't be enough
yet.


Nuitka Release 0.3.15
=====================

This is to inform you about the new stable release of Nuitka. This time again many
organizational improvements, some bug fixes, much improved compatibility and cleanups.

This release cycle had a focus on packaging Nuitka for easier consumption, i.e. automatic
packaging, making automatic uploads, improvement documentation, and generally cleaning
things up, so that Nuitka becomes more compatible and ultimately capable to run the "hg"
test suite. It's not there yet, but this is a huge jump for usability of Nuitka and its
compatibility, again.

Then lots of changes that make Nuitka approach Python3 support, the generated C++ for at
least one large example is compiling with this new release. It won't link, but there will
be later releases.

And there is a lot of cleanup going on, geared towards compatibility with line numbers in
the frame object.

Bug fixes
---------

- The main module was using "__main__" in tracebacks, but it should be
  "<module>". Released as 0.3.14a hotfix already.

- Workaround for "execfile cannot be used as an expression". It wasn't possible to use
  "execfile" in an expression, only as a statement.

  But then there is crazy enough code in e.g. mercurial that uses it in a lambda function,
  which made the issue more prominent. The fix now allows it to be an expression, except
  on the class level, which wasn't seen yet.

- The inline copy of Scons was not complete enough to work for "Windows" or with
  "--windows-target" for cross compile. Fixed.

- Cached frames didn't release the "back" frame, therefore holding variables of these
  longer than CPython does, which could cause ordering problems. Fixed for increased
  compatibility.

- Handle "yield outside of function" syntax error in compiled source correctly. This one
  was giving a Nuitka backtrace, now it gives a "SyntaxError" as it should.

- Made syntax/indentation error output absolutely identical to CPython.

- Using the frame objects "f_lineno" may fix endless amounts bugs related to traceback
  line numbers.

New Features
------------

- Guesses the location of the MinGW compiler under Windows to default install location, so
  it need not be added to "PATH" environment variable. Removes the need to modify "PATH"
  environment just for Nuitka to find it.

- Added support for "lambda generators". You don't want to know what it is. Lets just say,
  it was the last absurd language feature out there, plus that didn't work. It now works
  perfect.

Organizational
--------------

- You can now download a Windows installer and a Debian package that works on Debian
  Testing, current Ubuntu and Mint Linux.

- New release scripts give us the ability to have hotfix releases as download packages
  immediately. That means the "git flow" makes even more beneficial to the users.

- Including the generated "README.pdf" in the distribution archives, so it can be read
  instead of "README.txt". The text file is fairly readable, due to the use of
  ReStructured Text, but the PDF is even nicer to read, due to e.g. syntax highlighting of
  the examples.

- Renamed the main binaries to "nuitka" and "nuitka-python", so that there is no
  dependency on case sensitive file systems.

- For Windows there are batch files "nuitka.bat" and "nuitka-python.bat" to make Nuitka
  directly executable without finding the "Python.exe", which the batch files can tell
  from their own location.

- There are now man pages of "nuitka" and "nuitka-python" with examples for the most
  common use cases. They are of course included in the Debian package.

- Don't strip the binary when executing "benchmark.sh" to analyse compiled binary with
  "valgrind". It will give better information that way, without changing the code.

Optimizations
-------------

- Implemented "swapcontext" alike ("swapFiber") for x64 to achieve 8 times speedup for
  Generators. It doesn't do useless syscalls to preserve signal masks. Now Nuitka is
  faster at frame switching than CPython on x64, which is already good by design.

Cleanups
--------

- Using the frame objects to store current line of execution avoids the need to store it
  away in helper code at all. It ought to also help a lot with threading support, and
  makes Nuitka even more compatible, because now line numbers will be correct even outside
  tracebacks, but for mere stack frame dumps.

- Moved the "for_return" detection from code generation to tree building where it
  belongs. Yield statements used as return statements need slightly different code for
  Python2.6 difference. That solved an old TODO.

- Much Python3 portability work. Sometimes even improving existing code, the Python
  compiler code had picked up a few points, where the latest Nuitka didn't work with
  Python3 anymore, when put to actual compile.

  The test covered only syntax, but e.g. meta classes need different code in CPython3, and
  that's now supported. Also helper code was made portable in more places, but not yet
  fully. This will need more work.

- Cleaned up uses of debug defines, so they are now more consistent and in one place.

- Some more PyLint cleanups.

New Tests
---------

- The tests are now executed by Python scripts and cover "stderr" output too. Before we
  only checked "stdout". This unveiled a bunch of issues Nuitka had, but went unnoticed so
  far, and triggered e.g. the frame line number improvements.

- Separate syntax tests.

- The scripts to run the tests now are all in pure Python. This means, no more MinGW shell
  is needed to execute the tests.

Summary
-------

The Debian package, Windows installer, etc. are now automatically updated and
uploaded. From here on, there can be such packages for the hotfix releases too.

The exception tracebacks are now correct by design, and better covered.

The generator performance work showed that the approach taken by Nuitka is in fact
fast. It was fast on ARM already, but it's nice to see that it's now also fast on
x64. Programs using generators will be affected a lot by this.

Overall, this release brings Nuitka closer to usability. Better binary names, man pages,
improved documentation, issue tracker, etc. all there now. I am in fact now looking for a
sponsor for the Debian package to upload it into Debian directly.

.. admonition:: Update

   The upload to Debian happened for 0.3.18 and was done by Yaroslav Halchenko.

What's missing is more "hg" completeness. The frame release issue helped it, but
"inspect.getargs()" doesn't work yet, and is a topic for a future release. Won't be easy,
as "func_defaults" will be an invasive change too.


Nuitka Release 0.3.14
=====================

This is to inform you about the new stable release of Nuitka. This time it contains mostly
organisational improvements, some bug fixes, improved compatibility and cleanups.

It is again the result of working towards compilation of a real program (Mercurial). This
time, I have added support for proper handling of compiled types by the "inspect" module.

Bug fixes
---------

- Fix for "Missing checks in parameter parsing with star list, star dict and positional
  arguments". There was whole in the checks for argument counts, now the correct error is
  given. Fixed in 0.3.13a already.

- The simple slice operations with 2 values, not extended with 3 values, were not applying
  the correct order for evaluation. Fixed in 0.3.13a already.

- The simple slice operations couldn't handle "None" as the value for lower or upper
  index. Fixed in 0.3.11a already.

- The in-place simple slice operations evaluated the slice index expressions twice, which
  could cause problems if they had side effects. Fixed in 0.3.11a already.

New Features
------------

- Run time patching the "inspect" module so it accepts compiled functions, compiled
  methods, and compiled generator objects. The "test_inspect" test of CPython is nearly
  working unchanged with this.

- The generator functions didn't have "CO_GENERATOR" set in their code object, setting it
  made compatible with CPython in this regard too. The inspect module will therefore
  return correct value for "inspect.isgeneratorfunction()" too.

Optimizations
-------------

- Slice indexes that are "None" are now constant propagated as well.

- Slightly more efficient code generation for dual star arg functions, removing useless
  checks.

Cleanups
--------

- Moved the Scons, static C++ files, and assembler files to new package "nuitka.build"
  where also now "SconsInterface" module lives.

- Moved the Qt dialog files to "nuitka.gui"

- Moved the "unfreezer" code to its own static C++ file.

- Some PyLint cleanups.

New Tests
---------

- New test "Recursion" to cover recursive functions.

- New test "Inspection" to cover the patching of "inspect" module.

- Cover "execfile" on the class level as well in "ExecEval" test.

- Cover evaluation order of simple slices in "OrderCheck" too.

Organizational
--------------

- There is a new issue tracker available under http://bugs.nuitka.net

  Please register and report issues you encounter with Nuitka. I have put all the known
  issues there and started to use it recently. It's Roundup based like
  http://bugs.python.org is, so people will find it familiar.

- The "setup.py" is now apparently functional. The source releases for download are made
  it with, and it appears the binary distributions work too. We may now build a windows
  installer. It's currently in testing, we will make it available when finished.

Summary
-------

The new source organisation makes packaging Nuitka really easy now. From here, we can
likely provide "binary" package of Nuitka soon. A windows installer will be nice.

The patching of "inspect" works wonders for compatibility for those programs that insist
on checking types, instead of doing duck typing. The function call problem, was an issue
found by the Mercurial test suite.

For the "hg.exe" to pass all of its test suite, more work may be needed, this is the
overall goal I am currently striving for. Once real world programs like "hg" work, we can
use these as more meaningful benchmarks and resume work on optimization.


Nuitka Release 0.3.13
=====================

This release is mostly the result of working towards compilation of a real programs
(Mercurial) and to merge and finalize the frame stack work. Now Nuitka has a correct frame
stack at all times, and supports "func_code" and "gi_code" objects, something previously
thought to be impossible.

Actually now it's only the "bytecode" objects that won't be there. And not attributes of
"func_code" are meaningful yet, but in theory can be supported.

Due to the use of the git flow for Nuitka, most of the bugs listed here were already fixed
in on the stable release before this release. This time there were 5 such hotfix releases,
sometimes fixing multiple bugs.

Bug fixes
---------

- In case of syntax errors in the main program, an exception stack was giving that
  included Nuitka code. Changed to make the same output as CPython does. Fixed in 0.3.12a
  already.

- The star import ("from x import \*") didn't work for submodules. Providing "\*" as the
  import list to the respective code allowed to drop the complex lookups we were doing
  before, and to simply trust CPython C-API to do it correctly. Fixed in 0.3.12 already.

- The absolute import is *not* the default of CPython 2.7 it seems. A local "posix"
  package shadows the standard library one. Fixed in 0.3.12 already.

- In "--deep" mode, a module may contain a syntax error. This is e.g. true of "PyQt" with
  "port_v3" included. These files contain Python3 syntax and fail to be imported in
  Python2, but that should not be considered an error. These modules are now skipped with
  a warning. Fixed in 0.3.12b already.

- The code to import modules wasn't using the "__import__" builtin, which prevented
  "__import__" overriding code to work. Changed import to use the builtin. Fixed in
  0.3.12c already.

- The code generated for the "__import__" builtin with constant values was doing relative
  imports only. It should attempt relative and absolut imports. Fixed in 0.3.12c already.

- The code in "__init__.py" believed it was outside of the package, giving problems for
  package local imports. Fixed in 0.3.12d already.

- It appears that "Scons", which Nuitka uses internally and transparent to you, to execute
  the compilation and linking tasks, was sometimes not building the binaries or shared
  libraries, due to a false caching. As a workaround, these are now erased before doing
  the build. Fixed in 0.3.12d already.

- The use of "in" and "not in" in comparison chains (e.g. "a < b < c" is one), wasn't
  supported yet. The use of these in comparison chains "a in b in c" is very strange.

  Only in the "test_grammar.py" it was ever used I believe. Anyway, it's supported now,
  solving this TODO and reducing the difference. Fixed in 0.3.12e already.

- The order of evaluation for "in" and "not in" operators wasn't enforced in a portable
  way. Now it is correct on "ARM" too. Fixed in 0.3.12e already.

New Optimizations
-----------------

- The builtins "GeneratorExit" and "StopIteration" are optimized to their C-API names
  where possible as well.

Cleanups
--------

- The "__file__" attribute of modules was the relative filename, but for absolute
  filenames these become a horrible mess at least on Linux.

- Added assertion helpers for sane frame and code objects and use them.

- Make use of "assertObject" in more places.

- Instead of using "os.path.sep" all over, added a helper "Utils.joinpath" that hides this
  and using "os.path.join". This gives more readable code.

- Added traces to the "unfreezer" guarded by a define. Helpful in analyzing import
  problems.

- Some PyLint cleanups removing dead code, unused variables, useless pass statement, etc.

New Tests
---------

- New tests to cover "SyntaxError" and "IndentationError" from "--deep" imports and in
  main program.

- New test to cover evaluation order of "in" and "not in" comparisons.

- New test to cover package local imports made by  the "__init__.py" of the package.

Organizational
--------------

- Drop "compile_itself.sh" in favor of the new "compile_itself.py", because the later is
  more portable.

- The logging output is now nicer, and for failed recursions, outputs the line that is
  having the problem.

Summary
-------

The frame stack work and the "func_code" are big for compatibility.

The "func_code" was also needed for "hg" to work. For "hg" to pass all of its test suite,
more work will be needed, esp. the "inspect" module needs to be run-time patched to accept
compiled functions and generators too.

Once real world programs like "hg" work, we can use these as more meaningful benchmarks
and resume work on optimization.


Nuitka Release 0.3.12
=====================

This is to inform you about the new release of Nuitka many bug fixes, and substantial
improvements especially in the organizational area. There is a new User Manual (PDF), with
much improved content, a "sys.meta_path" based import mechanism for "--deep" mode, git
flow goodness.

This release is generally also the result of working towards compilation of a real
programs (Mercurial) and to get things work more nicely on Windows by default. Thanks go
to Liu Zhenhai for helping me with this goal.

Due to the use of the git flow, most of the bugs listed here were already fixed in on the
stable release before this release. And there were many of these.

Bug fixes
---------

- The order of evaluation for base classes and class dictionaries was not
  enforced.

  Apparently nothing in the CPython test suite did that, I only noticed during debugging
  that Nuitka gave a different error than CPython did, for a class that had an undefined
  base class, because both class body and base classes were giving an error. Fixed in
  0.3.11a already.

- Method objects didn't hold a reference to the used class.

  The effect was only noticed when "--python-debug" was used, i.e. the debug version of
  Python linked, because then the garbage collector makes searches. Fixed in 0.3.11b
  already.

- Set "sys.executable" on Linux as well. On Debian it is otherwise "/usr/bin/python" which
  might be a different version of Python entirely. Fixed in 0.3.11c already.

- Embedded modules inside a package could hide package variables of the same name. Learned
  during PyCON DE about this corner case. Fixed in 0.3.11d already.

- Packages could be duplicated internally. This had no effect on generated code other than
  appearing twice in the list if frozen modules. Fixed in 0.3.11d already.

- When embedding modules from outside current directory, the look-up failed. The embedding
  only ever worked for the compile itself and programs test cases, because they are all in
  the current directory then. Fixed in 0.3.11e already.

- The check for ARM target broke Windows support in the Scons file. Fixed in 0.3.11f
  already.

- The star import from external modules failed with an error in "--deep" mode. Fixed in
  0.3.11g already.

- Modules with a parent package could cause a problem under some circumstances. Fixed in
  0.3.11h already.

- One call variant, with both list and dict star arguments and keyword arguments, but no
  positional parameters, didn't have the required C++ helper function implemented. Fixed
  in 0.3.11h already.

- The detection of the CPU core count was broken on my hexacore at least. Gave 36 instead
  of 6, which is a problem for large programs. Fixed in 0.3.11h already.

- The inline copy of Scons didn't really work on Windows, which was sad, because we added
  it to simplify installation on Windows precisely because of this.

- Cleaning up the build directory from old sources and object files wasn't portable to
  Windows and therefore wasn't effective there.

- From imports where part of the imported were found modules and parts were not, didn't
  work. Solved by the feature branch "meta_path_import" that was merged for this release.

- Newer MinGW gave warnings about the default visibility not being possible to apply to
  class members. Fixed by not setting this default visibility anymore on Windows.

- The "sys.executable" gave warnings on Windows because of backslashes in the path. Using
  a raw string to prevent such problems.

- The standard library path was hard coded. Changed to run time detection.

Cleanups
--------

- Version checks on Python runtime now use a new define "PYTHON_VERSION" that makes it
  easier. I don't like "PY_VERSION_HEX", because it is so unreadable. Makes some of the
  checks a lot more safe.

- The "sys.meta_path" based import from the "meta_path_import" feature branch allowed the
  cleanup the way importing is done. It's a lot less code now.

- Removed some unused code. We should aim at making Nuitka the tool to detect dead code
  really.

- Moved "nuitka.Nodes" to "nuitka.nodes.Nodes", that is what the package is intended for,
  the split will come later.

New Tests
---------

- New tests for import variants that previously didn't work: Mixed imports. Imports from a
  package one level up. Modules hidden by a package variable, etc.

- Added test of function call variant that had no test previously. Only found it when
  compiling "hg". Amazing how nothing in my tests, CPython tests, etc. used it.

- Added test to cover the partial success of import statements.

- Added test to cover evaluation order of class definitions.

Organizational
--------------

- Migrated the "README.txt" from org-mode to ReStructured Text, which allows for a more
  readable document, and to generate a nice user manual in PDF form.

- The amount of information in "README.txt" was increased, with many more subjects are now
  covered, e.g. git flow and how to join Nuitka development. It's also impressive to see
  what code blocks and syntax highlighting can do for readability.

- The Nuitka git repository has seen multiple hotfixes.

  These allowed to publish bug fixes immediately after they were made, and avoided the
  need for a new release just to get these out. This really saves me a lot of time too,
  because I can postpone releasing the new version until it makes sense because of other
  things.

- Then there was a feature branch "meta_path_import" that lived until being merged to
  "develop" to improve the import code, which is now released on "master" as
  stable. Getting that feature right took a while.

- And there is the feature branch "minimize_CPython26_tests_diff" which has some success
  already in documenting the required changes to the CPython26 test suite and in reducing
  the amount of differences, while doing it. We have a frame stack working there, albeit
  in too ugly code form.

- The release archives are now built using "setuptools". You can now also download a zip
  file, which is probably more Windows friendly. The intention is to work on that to make
  "setup.py" produce a Nuitka install that won't rely on any environment variables at
  all. Right now "setup.py" won't even allow any other options than "sdist" to be given.

- Ported "compile_itself.sh" to "compile_itself.py", i.e. ported it to Python. This way,
  we can execute it easily on Windows too, where it currently still fails. Replacing
  "diff", "rm -rf", etc. is a challenge, but it reduces the dependency on MSYS tools on
  Windows.

- The compilation of standard library is disabled by default, but "site" or "dist"
  packages are now embedded. To include even standard library, there is a "--really-deep"
  option that has to be given in addition to "--deep", which forces this.

Summary
-------

Again, huge progress. The improved import mechanism is very beautiful. It appears that
little is missing to compile real world programs like "hg" with Nuitka. The next release
cycle will focus on that and continue to improve the Windows support which appears to have
some issues.


Nuitka Release 0.3.11
=====================

This is to inform you about the new release of Nuitka with some bug fixes and portability
work.

This release is generally cleaning up things, and makes Nuitka portable to ARM Linux. I
used to host the Nuitka homepage on that machine, but now that it's no longer so, I can
run heavy compile jobs on it. To my surprise, it found many portability problems. So I
chose to fix that first, the result being that Nuitka now works on ARM Linux too.

Bug fixes
---------

- The order of slice expressions was not correct on x86 as well, and I found that with new
  tests only. So the porting to ARM revealed a bug category, I previously didn't consider.

- The use of "linux2" in the Scons file is potentially incompatible with Linux 3.0,
  although it seems that at least on Debian the "sys.platform" was changed back to
  "linux2". Anyway, it's probably best to allow just anything that starts with "linux"
  these days.

- The "print" statement worked like a "print" function, i.e. it first evaluated all
  printed expressions, and did the output only then. That is incompatible in case of
  exceptions, where partial outputs should be done, and so that got fixed.

New Optimizations
-----------------

- Function calls now each have a dedicated helper function, avoiding in some cases
  unnecessary work. We will may build further on this and inline "PyObject_Call"
  differently for the special cases.

Cleanups
--------

- Moved many C++ helper declarations and inline implementations to dedicated header files
  for better organisation.

- Some dependencies were removed and consolidated to make the dependency graph sane.

- Multiple decorators were in reverse order in the node tree. The code generation reversed
  it back, so no bug, yet that was a distorted tree.

  Finding this came from the ARM work, because the "reversal" was in fact just the
  argument evaluation order of C++ under x86/x64, but on ARM that broke. Correcting it
  highlighted this issue.

- The deletion of slices, was not using "Py_ssize" for indexes, disallowing some kinds of
  optimizations, so that was harmonized.

- The function call code generation got a general overhaul. It is now more consistent, has
  more helpers available, and creates more readable code.

- PyLint is again happier than ever.

New Tests
---------

- There is a new basic test "OrderChecks" that covers the order of expression
  evaluation. These problems were otherwise very hard to detect, and in some cases not
  previously covered at all.

- Executing Nuitka with Python3 (it won't produce correct Python3 C API code) is now part
  of the release tests, so non-portable code of Nuitka gets caught.

Organizational
--------------

- Support for ARM Linux. I will make a separate posting on the challenges of this. Suffice
  to say now, that C++ leaves way too much things unspecified.

- The Nuitka git repository now uses git flow. The new git policy will be detailed in
  another `separate posting <http://nuitka.net/blog/2011/10/nuitka-git-flow/>`_.

- There is an unstable "develop" branch in which the development occurs. For this release
  ca. 40 commits were done to this branch, before merging it. I am also doing more fine
  grained commits now.

- Unlike previously, there is "master" branch for the stable release.

- There is a script "make-dependency-graph.sh" to produce a dependency graphs of Nuitka. I
  detected a couple of strange things through this.

- The Python3 "__pycache__" directories get removed too by the cleanup script.

Numbers
-------

We only have PyStone now, and on a new machine, so the numbers cannot be compared to previous releases:

python 2.6::

  Pystone(1.1) time for 50000 passes = 0.48
  This machine benchmarks at 104167 pystones/second

Nuitka 0.3.11 (driven by python 2.6)::

  Pystone(1.1) time for 50000 passes = 0.19
  This machine benchmarks at 263158 pystones/second

So this a speedup factor of 258%, last time on another machine it was 240%. Yet it only
proves that the generated and compiled are more efficient than bytecode, but Nuitka
doesn't yet do the relevant optimizations. Only once it does, the factor will be
significantly higher.

Summary
-------

Overall, there is quite some progress. Nuitka is a lot cleaner now, which will help us
later only. I wanted to get this out, mostly because of the bug fixes, and of course just
in case somebody attempts to use it on ARM.


Nuitka Release 0.3.10
=====================

This new release is major milestone 2 work, enhancing practically all areas of Nuitka. The
focus was roundup and breaking new grounds with structural optimization enhancements.

Bug fixes
---------

- Exceptions now correctly stack.

  When you catch an exception, there always was the exception set, but calling a new
  function, and it catching the exception, the values of "sys.exc_info()" didn't get reset
  after the function returned.

  This was a small difference (of which there are nearly none left now) but one that might
  effect existing code, which affects code that calls functions in exception handling to
  check something about it.

  So it's good this is resolved now too. Also because it is difficult to understand, and
  now it's just like CPython behaves, which means that we don't have to document anything
  at all about it.

- Using "exec" in generator functions got fixed up. I realized that this wouldn't work
  while working on other things. It's obscure yes, but it ought to work.

- Lambda generator functions can now be nested and in generator functions. There were some
  problems here with the allocation of closure variables that got resolved.

- List contractions could not be returned by lambda functions. Also a closure issue.

- When using a mapping for globals to "exec" or "eval" that had a side effect on lookup,
  it was evident that the lookup was made twice. Correcting this also improves the
  performance for the normal case.

New Optimizations
-----------------

- Statically raised as well as predicted exceptions are propagated upwards, leading to
  code and block removal where possible, while maintaining the side effects.

  This is brand new and doesn't do everything possible yet. Most notable, the matching of
  raised exception to handlers is not yet performed.

- Builtin exception name references and creation of instances of them are now optimized as
  well, which should lead to faster exception raising/catching for these cases.

- More kinds of calls to builtins are handled, positional parameters are checked and more
  builtins are covered.

  Notable is that now checks are performed if you didn't potentially overload e.g. the
  "len" with your own version in the module. Locally it was always detected already. So
  it's now also safe.

- All operations and comparisons are now simulated if possible and replaced with their
  result.

- In the case of predictable true or false conditions, not taken branches are removed.

- Empty branches are now removed from most constructs, leading to sometimes cleaner code
  generated.

Cleanups
--------

- Removed the lambda body node and replaced it with function body. This is a great win for
  the split into body and builder. Regular functions and lambda functions now only differ
  in how the created body is used.

- Large cleanup of the operation/comparison code. There is now only use of a simulator
  function, which exists for every operator and comparison. This one is then used in a
  prediction call, shared with the builtin predictions.

- Added a "Tracing" module to avoid future imports of "print_function", which annoyed me
  many times by causing syntax failures for when I quickly added a print statement, not
  noting it must have the braces.

- PyLint is happier than ever.

New Tests
---------

- Enhanced "OverflowFunctions" test to cover even deeper nesting of overflow functions
  taking closure from each level. While it's not yet working, this makes clearer what will
  be needed. Even if this code is obscure, I would like to be that correct here.

- Made "Operators" test to cover the `` operator as well.

- Added to "ListContractions" the case where a contraction is returned by a lambda
  function, but still needs to leak its loop variable.

- Enhanced "GeneratorExpressions" test to cover lambda generators, which is really crazy
  code:

  .. code-block:: python

     def y():
         yield((yield 1),(yield 2))

- Added to "ExecEval" a case where the "exec" is inside a generator, to cover that too.

- Activated the testing of "sys.exc_info()" in "ExceptionRaising" test. This was
  previously commented out, and now I added stuff to illustrate all of the behaviour of
  CPython there.

- Enhanced "ComparisonChains" test to demonstrate that the order of evaluations is done
  right and that side effects are maintained.

- Added "BuiltinOverload" test to show that overloaded builtins are actually called and
  not the optimized version. So code like this has to print 2 lines:

  .. code-block:: python

     from __builtin__ import len as _len

     def len( x ):
        print x

     return _len(x)

     print len(range(9))

Organizational
--------------

- Changed "README.txt" to no longer say that "Scons" is a requirement. Now that it's
  included (patched up to work with "ctypes" on Windows), we don't have to say that
  anymore.

- Documented the status of optimizations and added some more ideas.

- There is now an option to dump the node tree after optimization as XML. Not currently
  use, but is for regression testing, to identify where new optimization and changes have
  an impact. This make it more feasible to be sure that Nuitka is only becoming better.

- Executable with Python3 again, although it won't do anything, the necessary code changes
  were done.

Summary
-------

It's nice to see, that I some long standing issues were resolved, and that structural
optimization has become almost a reality.

The difficult parts of exception propagation are all in place, now it's only details. With
that we can eliminate and predict even more of the stupid code of "pybench" at compile
time, achieving more infinite speedups.


Nuitka Release 0.3.9
====================

This is about the new release of Nuitka which some bug fixes and offers a good speed
improvement.

This new release is major milestone 2 work, enhancing practically all areas of Nuitka. The
main focus was on faster function calls, faster class attributes (not instance), faster
unpacking, and more builtins detected and more thoroughly optimizing them.

Bug fixes
---------

- Exceptions raised inside with statements had references to the exception and traceback
  leaked.

- On Windows the binaries "sys.executable" pointed to the binary itself instead of the
  Python interpreter. Changed, because some code uses "sys.executable" to know how to
  start Python scripts.

- There is a bug (fixed in their repository) related to C++ raw strings and C++
  "trigraphs" that affects Nuitka, added a workaround that makes Nuitka not emit
  "trigraphs" at all.

- The check for mutable constants was erroneous for tuples, which could lead to assuming a
  tuple with only mutable elements to be not mutable, which is of course wrong.

New Optimizations
-----------------

This time there are so many new optimizations, it makes sense to group them by the subject.

Exceptions
~~~~~~~~~~

- The code to add a traceback is now our own, which made it possible to use frames that do
  not contain line numbers and a code object capable of lookups.

- Raising exceptions or adding to tracebacks has been made way faster by reusing a cached
  frame objects for the task.

- The class used for saving exceptions temporarily (e.g. used in try/finally code, or with
  statement) has been improved so it doesn't make a copy of the exception with a C++ "new"
  call, but it simply stores the exception properties itself and creates the exception
  object only on demand, which is more efficient.

- When catching exceptions, the addition of tracebacks is now done without exporting and
  re-importing the exception to Python, but directly on the exception objects traceback,
  this avoids a useless round trip.

Function Calls
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

- Uses of PyObject_Call provide "NULL" as the dictionary, instead of an empty dictionary,
  which is slightly faster for function calls.

- There are now dedicated variants for complex function calls with "\*" and "\*\*"
  arguments in all forms. These can take advantage of easier cases. For example, a merge
  with star arguments is only needed if there actually were any of these.

- The check for non-string values in the "\*\*" arguments can now be completely short-cut
  for the case of a dictionary that has never had a string added. There is now code that
  detects this case and skips the check, eliminating it as a performance concern.

Parameter Parsing
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

- Reversed the order in which parameters are checked.

  Now the keyword dictionary is iterated first and only then the positional arguments
  after that is done. This iteration is not only much faster (avoiding repeated lookups
  for each possible parameter), it also can be more correct, in case the keyword argument
  is derived from a dictionary and its keys mutate it when being compared.

- Comparing parameter names is now done with a fast path, in which the pointer values are
  compare first. This can avoid a call to the comparison at all, which has become very
  likely due to the interning of parameter name strings, see below.

- Added a dedicated call to check for parameter equality with rich equality comparison,
  which doesn't raise an exception.

- Unpacking of tuples is now using dedicated variants of the normal unpacking code instead
  of rolling out everything themselves.

Attribute Access
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

- The class type (in executables, not yet for extension modules) is changed to a faster
  variant of our own making that doesn't consider the restricted mode a possibility. This
  avoids very expensive calls, and makes accessing class attributes in compiled code and
  in non-compiled code faster.

- Access to attributes (but not of instances) got inlined and therefore much faster. Due
  to other optimizations, a specific step to intern the string used for attribute access
  is not necessary with Nuitka at all anymore. This made access to attributes about 50%
  faster which is big of course.

Constants
~~~~~~~~~

- The bug for mutable tuples also caused non-mutable tuples to be considered as mutable,
  which lead to less efficient code.

- The constant creation with the g++ bug worked around, can now use raw strings to create
  string constants, without resorting to un-pickling them as a work around. This allows us
  to use "PyString_FromStringAndSize" to create strings again, which is obviously faster,
  and had not been done, because of the confusion caused by the g++ bug.

- For string constants that are usable as attributes (i.e. match the identifier regular
  expression), these are now interned, directly after creation. With this, the check for
  identical value of pointers for parameters has a bigger chance to succeed, and this
  should save some memory too.

- For empty containers (set, dict, list, tuple) the constants created are now are not
  unstreamed, but created with the dedicated API calls, saving a bit of code and being
  less ugly.

- For mutable empty constant access (set, dict, list) the values are no longer made by
  copying the constant, but instead with the API functions to create new ones. This makes
  code like "a = []" a tiny bit faster.

- For slice indices the code generation now takes advantage of creating a C++ "Py_ssize_t"
  from constant value if possible. Before it was converting the integer constant at run
  time, which was of course wasteful even if not (very) slow.

Iteration
~~~~~~~~~

- The creation of iterators got our own code. This avoids a function call and is otherwise
  only a small gain for anything but sequence iterators. These should be much faster to
  create now, as it avoids another call and repeated checks.

- The next on iterator got our own code too, which has simpler code flow, because it
  avoids the double check in case of NULL returned.

- The unpack check got simlar code to the next iterator, it also has simpler code flow now
  and avoids double checks.

Builtins
~~~~~~~~

- Added support for the "list", "tuple", "dict", "str", "float" and "bool" builtins along
  with optimizing their use with constant parameter.

- Added support for the "int" and "long" builtins, based on a new "call spec" object, that
  detects parameter errors at compile time and raises appropriate exceptions as required,
  plus it deals with keyword arguments just as well.

  So, to Nuitka it doesn't matter now it you write "int( value ) "or "int( x = value )"
  anymore. The "base" parameter of these builtins is also supported.

  The use of this call spec mechanism will the expanded, currently it is not applied to
  the builtins that take only one parameter. This is a work in progress as is the whole
  builtins business as not all the builtins are covered yet.

Cleanups
~~~~~~~~

- In 0.3.8 per module global classes were introduced, but the "IMPORT_MODULE" kept using
  the old universal class, this got resolved and the old class is now fully gone.

- Using "assertObject" in more cases, and in more places at all, catches errors earlier
  on.

- Moved the addition to tracebacks into the "_PythonException" class, where it works
  directly on the contained traceback. This is cleaner as it no longer requires to export
  exceptions to Python, just to add a traceback entry.

- Some "PyLint" cleanups were done, reducing the number of reports a bit, but there is
  still a lot to do.

- Added a "DefaultValueIdentifier" class that encapsulates the access to default values in
  the parameter parsing more cleanly.

- The module "CodeTemplatesListContractions" was renamed to "CodeTemplatesContractions" to
  reflect the fact that it deals with all kinds of contractions (also set and dict
  contractions), not just list contractions.

- Moved the with related template to its own module "CodeTemplatesWith", so its easier to
  find.

- The options handling for g++ based compilers was cleaned up, so that g++ 4.6 and MinGW
  are better supported now.

- Documented more aspects of the Scons build file.

- Some more generated code white space fixes.

- Moved some helpers to dedicated files. There is now "calling.hpp" for function calls, an
  "importing.cpp" for import related stuff.

- Moved the manifest generation to the scons file, which should now produce more ready to
  use executables.

New Tests
---------

- Added a improved version of "pybench" that can cope with the "0 ms" execution time that
  Nuitka has for some if its sub-tests.

- Reference counting test for with statement was added.

- Micro benchmarks to demonstrate try finally performance when an exception travels
  through it.

- Micro benchmark for with statement that eats up exceptions raised inside the block.

- Micro benchmarks for the read and write access to class attributes.

- Enhanced "Printing" test to cover the trigraphs constant bug case. Output is required to
  make the error detectable.

- Enhanced "Constants" test to cover repeated mutation of mutable tuple constants, this
  covers the bug mentioned.

Organizational
--------------

- Added a credits section to the "README.txt" where I give credit to the people who
  contributed to Nuitka, and the projects it is using. I will make it a separate posting
  to cite these.

- Documented the requirements on the compiler more clearly, document the fact that we
  require scons and which version of Python (2.6 or 2.7).

- The is now a codespeed implementation up and running with historical data for up to
  Nuitka 0.3.8 runs of pystone and with pybench. It will be updated for 0.3.9 once I have
  the infrastructure in place to do that automatically.

- The cleanup script now also removes .so files.

- The handling of options for g++ got improved, so it's the same for g++ and MinGW
  compilers, plus adequate errors messages are given, if the compiler version is too low.

- There is now a "--unstriped" option that just keeps the debug information in the file,
  but doesn't keep the assertions. This will be helpful when looking at generated
  assembler code from Nuitka to not have the distortions that "--debug" causes (reduced
  optimization level, assertions, etc.) and instead a clear view.


Nuitka Release 0.3.8
====================

This is to inform you about the new release of Nuitka with some real news and a slight
performance increase. The significant news is added "Windows Support". You can now hope to
run Nuitka on Windows too and have it produce working executables against either the
standard Python distribution or a MinGW compiled Python.

There are still some small things to iron out, and clearly documentation needs to be
created, and esp. the DLL hell problem of "msvcr90.dll" vs. "msvcrt.dll", is not yet fully
resolved, but appears to be not as harmful, at least not on native Windows.

I am thanking Khalid Abu Bakr for making this possible.  I was surprised to see this
happen. I clearly didn't make it easy. He found a good way around "ucontext", identifier
clashes, and a very tricky symbol problems where the CPython library under Windows exports
less than under Linux. Thanks a whole lot.

Currently the Windows support should be considered experimental and works with MinGW 4.5
or higher only.

Otherwise there have been the usual round of performance improvements and more
cleanups. This release is otherwise milestone 2 work only, which will have to continue for
some time more.

Bug fixes
---------

- Lambda generators were not fully compatible, their simple form could yield an extra
  value. The behavior for Python 2.6 and 2.7 is also different and Nuitka now mimics both
  correctly, depending on the used Python version

- The given parameter count cited in the error message in case of too many parameters,
  didn't include the given keyword parameters in the error message.

- There was an "assert False" right after warning about not found modules in the "--deep"
  mode, which was of course unnecessary.

New Optimizations
-----------------

- When unpacking variables in assignments, the temporary variables are now held in a new
  temporary class that is designed for the task specifically.

  This avoids the taking of a reference just because the "PyObjectTemporary" destructor
  insisted on releasing one. The new class "PyObjectTempHolder" hands the existing
  reference over and releases only in case of exceptions.

- When unpacking variable in for loops, the value from the iterator may be directly
  assigned, if it's to a variable.

  In general this would be possible for every assignment target that cannot raise, but the
  infrastructure cannot tell yet, which these would be. This will improve with more
  milestone 3 work.

- Branches with only "pass" inside are removed, "pass" statements are removed before the
  code generation stage. This makes it easier to achieve and decide empty branches.

- There is now a global variable class per module. It appears that it is indeed faster to
  roll out a class per module accessing the "module \*" rather than having one class and
  use a "module \*\*", which is quite disappointing from the C++ compiler.

- Also "MAKE_LIST" and "MAKE_TUPLE" have gained special cases for the 0 arguments
  case. Even when the size of the variadic template parameters should be known to the
  compiler, it seems, it wasn't eliminating the branch, so this was a speedup measured
  with valgrind.

- Empty tried branches are now replaced when possible with try/except statements,
  try/finally is simplified in this case. This gives a cleaner tree structure and less
  verbose C++ code which the compiler threw away, but was strange to have in the first
  place.

- In conditions the "or" and "and" were evaluated with Python objects instead of with C++
  bool, which was unnecessary overhead.

- List contractions got more clever in how they assign from the iterator value.

  It now uses a "PyObjectTemporary" if it's assigned to multiple values, a
  "PyObjectTempHolder" if it's only assigned once, to something that could raise, or a
  "PyObject \*" if an exception cannot be raised. This avoids temporary references
  completely for the common case.

Cleanups
--------

- The "if", "for", and "while" statements had always empty "else" nodes which were then
  also in the generated C++ code as empty branches. No harm to performance, but this got
  cleaned up.

- Some more generated code white space fixes.

New Tests
---------

- The CPython 2.7 test suite now also has the "doctests" extracted to static tests, which
  improves test coverage for Nuitka again.

  This was previously only done for CPython 2.6 test suite, but the test suites are
  different enough to make this useful, e.g. to discover newly changed behavior like with
  the lambda generators.

- Added Shed Skin 0.7.1 examples as benchmarks, so we can start to compare Nuitka
  performance in these tests. These will be the focus of numbers for the 0.4.x release
  series.

- Added a micro benchmark to check unpacking behavior. Some of these are needed to prove
  that a change is an actual improvement, when its effect can go under in noise of inline
  vs. no-inline behavior of the C++ compiler.

- Added "pybench" benchmark which reveals that Nuitka is for some things much faster, but
  there are still fields to work on. This version needed changes to stand the speed of
  Nuitka. These will be subject of a later posting.

Organizational
--------------

- There is now a "tests/benchmarks/micro" directory to contain tiny benchmarks that just
  look at a single aspect, but have no other meaning, e.g. the "PyStone" extracts fall
  into this category.

- There is now a "--windows-target" option that attempts a cross-platform build on Linux
  to Windows executable. This is using "MingGW-cross-env" cross compilation tool
  chain. It's not yet working fully correctly due to the DLL hell problem with the C
  runtime. I hope to get this right in subsequent releases.

- The "--execute" option uses wine to execute the binary if it's a cross-compile for
  windows.

- Native windows build is recognized and handled with MinGW 4.5, the VC++ is not supported
  yet due to missing C++0x support.

- The basic test suite ran with Windows so far only and some adaptations were
  necessary. Windows new lines are now ignored in difference check, and addresses under
  Windows are upper case, small things.

Numbers
-------

python 2.6::

  Pystone(1.1) time for 50000 passes = 0.65
  This machine benchmarks at 76923.1 pystones/second

Nuitka 0.3.8 (driven by python 2.6)::

  Pystone(1.1) time for 50000 passes = 0.27
  This machine benchmarks at 185185 pystones/second

This is a 140% speed increase of 0.3.8 compared to CPython, up from 132% compared to the
previous release.


Nuitka Release 0.3.7
====================

This is about the new release with focus on performance and cleanups. It indicates
significant progress with the milestone this release series really is about as it adds a
"compiled_method" type.

So far functions, generator function, generator expressions were compiled objects, but in
the context of classes, functions were wrapped in CPython "instancemethod" objects. The
new "compiled_method" is specifically designed for wrapping "compiled_function" and
therefore more efficient at it.

Bug fixes
---------

- When using "Python" or "Nuitka.py" to execute some script, the exit code in case of
  "file not found" was not the same as CPython. It should be 2, not 1.

- The exit code of the created programs ("--deep" mode) in case of an uncaught exception
  was 0, now it an error exit with value 1, like CPython does it.

- Exception tracebacks created inside "with" statements could contain duplicate lines,
  this was corrected.

New Optimizations
-----------------

- Global variable assignments now also use "assign0" where no reference exists.

  The assignment code for module variables is actually faster if it needs not drop the
  reference, but clearly the code shouldn't bother to take it on the outside just for
  that. This variant existed, but wasn't used as much so far.

- The instance method objects are now Nuitka's own compiled type too. This should make
  things slightly faster by itself.

- Our new compiled method objects support dedicated method parsing code, where "self" is
  passed directly, allowing to make calls taking a fast path in parameter parsing.

  This avoids allocating/freeing a "tuple" object per method call, while reduced 3% ticks
  in "PyStone" benchmark, so that's significant.

- Solved a TODO of "BUILTIN_RANGE" to change it to pre-allocating the list in the final
  size as we normally do everywhere else. This was a tick reduction of 0.4% in "PyStone"
  benchmark, but the measurement method normalizes on loop speed, so it's not visible in
  the numbers output.

- Parameter variables cannot possibly be uninitialized at creation and most often they are
  never subject to a "del" statement. Adding dedicated C++ variable classes gave a big
  speedup, around 3% of PyStone benchmark ticks.

- Some abstract object operations were re-implemented, which allows to avoid function
  calls e.g. in the "ITERATOR_NEXT" case, this gave a few percent on "PyStone" as well.

Cleanups
--------

- New package "nuitka.codegen" to contain all code generation related stuff, moved
  "nuitka.templates" to "nuitka.codegen.templates" as part of that.

- Inside the "nuitka.codegen" package the "MainControl" module now longer reaches into
  "Generator" for simple things, but goes through "CodeGeneration" for everything now.

- The "Generator" module uses almost no tree nodes anymore, but instead gets information
  passed in function calls. This allows for a cleanup of the interface towards
  "CodeGeneration". Gives a cleaner view on the C++ code generation, and generally
  furthers the goal of other than C++ language backends.

- More "PyLint" work, many of the reported warnings have been addressed, but it's not yet
  happy.

- Defaults for "yield" and "return" are "None" and these values are now already added (as
  constants) during tree building so that no such special cases need to be dealt with in
  "CodeGeneration" and future analysis steps.

- Parameter parsing code has been unified even further, now the whole entry point is
  generated by one of the function in the new "nuitka.codegen.ParameterParsing" module.

- Split variable, exception, builtin helper classes into separate header files.

New Tests
---------

- The exit codes of CPython execution and Nuitka compiled programs are now compared as
  well.

- Errors messages of methods are now covered by the "ParameterErrors" test as well.

Organizational
--------------

- The "benchmark.sh" script now starts "kcachegrind" to display the valgrind result
  directly.

  One can now use "benchmark.sh" to execute a test and inspect valgrind information right
  away, then improve it. Very useful to discover methods for improvements, test them, then
  refine some more.

- The "check-release.sh" script needs to unset "NUITKA_EXTRA_OPTIONS" or else the
  reflection test will trip over the changed output paths.

Numbers

python 2.6::

  Pystone(1.1) time for 50000 passes = 0.65
  This machine benchmarks at 76923.1 pystones/second

Nuitka 0.3.7 (driven by python 2.6)::

  Pystone(1.1) time for 50000 passes = 0.28
  This machine benchmarks at 178571 pystones/second

This is a 132% speed of 0.3.7 compared to CPython, up from 109% compare to the previous
release. This is a another small increase, that can be fully attributed to milestone 2
measures, i.e. not analysis, but purely more efficient C++ code generation and the new
compiled method type.

One can now safely assume that it is at least twice as fast, but I will try and get the
PyPy or Shedskin test suite to run as benchmarks to prove it.

No milestone 3 work in this release. I believe it's best to finish with milestone 2 first,
because these are quite universal gains that we should have covered.


Nuitka Release 0.3.6
====================

The major point this for this release is cleanup work, and generally bug fixes, esp. in
the field of importing. This release cleans up many small open ends of Nuitka, closing
quite a bunch of consistency TODOs, and then aims at cleaner structures internally, so
optimization analysis shall become "easy". It is a correctness and framework release, not
a performance improvement at all.

Bug fixes
---------

- Imports were not respecting the "level" yet. Code like this was not working, now it is.

  .. code-block:: python

     from .. import something

- Absolute and relative imports were e.g. both tried all the time, now if you specify
  absolute or relative imports, it will be attempted in the same way than CPython
  does. This can make a difference with compatibility.

- Functions with a "locals dict" (using "locals" builtin or "exec" statement) were not
  100% compatible in the way the locals dictionary was updated, this got fixed. It seems
  that directly updating a dict is not what CPython does at all, instead it only pushes
  things to the dictionary, when it believes it has to. Nuitka now does the same thing,
  making it faster and more compatible at the same time with these kind of corner cases.

- Nested packages didn't work, they do now. Nuitka itself is now successsfully using
  nested packages (e.g. "nuitka.transform.optimizations")

New Features
------------

- The "--lto" option becomes usable. It's not measurably faster immediately, and it
  requires g++ 4.6 to be available, but then it at least creates smaller binaries and may
  provide more optimizations in the future.

New Optimizations
-----------------

- Exceptions raised by pre-computed builtins, unpacking, etc. are now transformed to
  raising the exception statically.

Cleanups
--------

- There is now a "getVariableForClosure" that a variable provider can use. Before that it
  guessed from "getVariableForReference" or "getVariableForAssignment" what might be the
  intention. This makes some corner cases easier.

- Classes, functions and lambdas now also have separate builder and body nodes, which
  enabled to make getSameScopeNodes() really simple. Either something has children which
  are all in a new scope or it has them in the same scope.

- Twisted workarounds like "TransitiveProvider" are no longer needed, because class
  builder and class body were separated.

- New packages "nuitka.transform.optimizations" and "nutika.transform.finalizations",
  where the first was "nuitka.optimizations" before. There is also code in
  "nuitka.transform" that was previously in a dedicated module. This allowed to move a lot
  of displaced code.

- "TreeBuilding" now has fast paths for all 3 forms, things that need a "provider",
  "node", and "source_ref"; things that need "node" and "source_ref"; things that need
  nothing at all, e.g. pass.

- Variables now avoid building duplicated instances, but instead share one. Better for
  analysis of them.

New Tests
---------

- The Python 2.7 test suite is no longer run with Python 2.6 as it will just crash with
  the same exception all the time, there is no "importlib" in 2.6, but every test is using
  that through test_support.

- Nested packages are now covered with tests too.

- Imports of upper level packages are covered now too.

Organizational
--------------

- Updated the "README.txt" with the current plan on optimizations.

Numbers
-------

python 2.6::

  Pystone(1.1) time for 50000 passes = 0.65
  This machine benchmarks at 76923.1 pystones/second

Nuitka 0.3.6 (driven by python 2.6)::

  Pystone(1.1) time for 50000 passes = 0.31
  This machine benchmarks at 161290 pystones/second

This is 109% for 0.3.6, but no change from the previous release. No surprise, because no
new effective new optimization means have been implemented. Stay tuned for future release
for actual progress.


Nuitka Release 0.3.5
====================

This new release of Nuitka is an overall improvement on many fronts, there is no real
focus this time, likely due to the long time it was in the making.

The major points are more optimization work, largely enhanced import handling and another
improvement on the performance side. But there are also many bug fixes, more test
coverage, usability and compatibility.

Something esp. noteworthy to me and valued is that many important changes were performed
or at least triggered by Nicolas Dumazet, who contributed a lot of high quality commits as
you can see from the gitweb history. He appears to try and compile Mercurial and Nuitka,
and this resulted in important contributions.

Bug fixes
---------

- Nicolas found a reference counting bug with nested parameter calls. Where a function had
  parameters of the form "a, (b,c)" it could crash. This got fixed and covered with a
  reference count test.
- Another reference count problem when accessing the locals dictionary was corrected.
- Values "0.0" and "-0.0" were treated as the same. They are not though, they have a
  different sign that should not get lost.
- Nested contractions didn't work correctly, when the contraction was to iterate over
  another contraction which needs a closure. The problem was addressing by splitting the
  building of a contraction from the body of the contraction, so that these are now 2
  nodes, making it easy for the closure handling to get things right.
- Global statements in function with local "exec()" would still use the value from the
  locals dictionary. Nuitka is now compatible to CPython with this too.
- Nicolas fixed problems with modules of the same name inside different packages. We now
  use the full name including parent package names for code generation and lookups.
- The "__module__" attribute of classes was only set after the class was created. Now it
  is already available in the class body.
- The "__doc__" attribute of classes was not set at all. Now it is.
- The relative import inside nested packages now works correctly. With Nicolas moving all
  of Nuitka to a package, the compile itself exposed many weaknesses.
- A local re-raise of an exception didn't have the original line attached but the re-raise
  statement line.

New Features
------------

- Modules and packages have been unified. Packages can now also have code in "__init__.py"
  and then it will be executed when the package is imported.
- Nicolas added the ability to create deep output directory structures without having to
  create them beforehand. This makes "--output-dir=some/deep/path" usable.
- Parallel build by Scons was added as an option and enabled by default, which enhances
  scalability for "--deep" compilations a lot.
- Nicolas enhanced the CPU count detection used for the parallel build. Turned out that
  "multithreading.cpu_count()" doesn't give us the number of available cores, so he
  contributed code to determine that.
- Support for upcoming g++ 4.6 has been added. The use of the new option "--lto" has been
  been prepared, but right now it appears that the C++ compiler will need more fixes,
  before we can this feature with Nuitka.
- The "--display-tree" feature got an overhaul and now displays the node tree along with
  the source code. It puts the cursor on the line of the node you selected. Unfortunately
  I cannot get it to work two-way yet. I will ask for help with this in a separate posting
  as we can really use a "python-qt" expert it seems.
- Added meaningful error messages in the "file not found" case. Previously I just didn't
  care, but we sort of approach end user usability with this.

New Optimizations
-----------------

- Added optimization for the builtin "range()" which otherwise requires a module and
  builtin module lookup, then parameter parsing. Now this is much faster with Nuitka and
  small ranges (less than 256 values) are converted to constants directly, avoiding run
  time overhead entirely.
- Code for re-raise statements now use a simple re-throw of the exception where possible,
  and only do the hard work where the re-throw is not inside an exception handler.
- Constant folding of operations and comparisons is now performed if the operands are
  constants.
- Values of some builtins are pre-computed if the operands are constants.
- The value of module attribute "__name__" is replaced by a constant unless it is assigned
  to. This is the first sign of upcoming constant propagation, even if only a weak one.
- Conditional statement and/or their branches are eliminated where constant conditions
  allow it.

Cleanups
--------

- Nicolas moved the Nuitka source code to its own "nuitka" package. That is going to make
  packaging it a lot easier and allows cleaner code.
- Nicolas introduced a fast path in the tree building which often delegates (or should do
  that) to a function. This reduced a lot of the dispatching code and highlights more
  clearly where such is missing right now.
- Together we worked on the line length issues of Nuitka. We agreed on a style and very
  long lines will vanish from Nuitka with time. Thanks for pushing me there.
- Nicolas also did provide many style fixes and general improvements, e.g. using
  "PyObjectTemporary" in more places in the C++ code, or not using "str.find" where "x in
  y" is a better choice.
- The node structure got cleaned up towards the direction that assigments always have an
  assignment as a child. A function definition, or a class definition, are effectively
  assignments, and in order to not have to treat this as special cases everywhere, they
  need to have assignment targets as child nodes.

  Without such changes, optimizations will have to take too many things into account. This
  is not yet completed.
- Nicolas merged some node tree building functions that previously handled deletion and
  assigning differently, giving us better code reuse.
- The constants code generation was moved to a "__constants.cpp" where it doesn't make
  __main__.cpp so much harder to read anymore.
- The module declarations have been moved to their own header files.
- Nicolas cleaned up the scripts used to test Nuitka big time, removing repetitive code
  and improving the logic. Very much appreciated.
- Nicolas also documented a things in the Nuitka source code or got me to document things
  that looked strange, but have reasons behind it.
- Nicolas solved the TODO related to builtin module accesses. These will now be way faster
  than before.
- Nicolas also solved the TODO related to the performance of "locals dict" variable
  accesses.
- Generator.py no longer contains classes. The Contexts objects are supposed to contain
  the state, and as such the generator objects never made much sense.
- Also with the help of Scons community, I figured out how to avoid having object files
  inside the "src" directory of Nuitka. That should also help packaging, now all build
  products go to the .build directory as they should.
- The vertical white space of the generated C++ got a few cleanups, trailing/leading new
  line is more consistent now, and there were some assertions added that it doesn't
  happen.

New Tests
---------

- The CPython 2.6 tests are now also run by CPython 2.7 and the other way around and need
  to report the same test failure reports, which found a couple of issues.
- Now the test suite is run with and without "--debug" mode.
- Basic tests got extended to cover more topics and catch more issues.
- Program tests got extended to cover code in packages.
- Added more exec scope tests. Currently inlining of exec statements is disabled though,
  because it requires entirely different rules to be done right, it has been pushed back
  to the next release.

Organizational
--------------

- The "g++-nuitka" script is no more. With the help of the Scons community, this is now
  performed inside the scons and only once instead of each time for every C++ file.
- When using "--debug", the generated C++ is compiled with "-Wall and -Werror" so that
  some form of bugs in the generated C++ code will be detected immediately. This found a
  few issues already.
- There is a new git merge policy in place. Basically it says, that if you submit me a
  pull request, that I will deal with it before publishing anything new, so you can rely
  on the current git to provide you a good base to work on. I am doing more frequent
  pre-releases already and I would like to merge from your git.
- The "README.txt" was updated to reflect current optimization status and plans. There is
  still a lot to do before constant propagation can work, but this explains things a bit
  better now. I hope to expand this more and more with time.
- There is now a "misc/clean-up.sh" script that prints the commands to erase all the
  temporary files sticking around in the source tree. That is for you if you like me, have
  other directories inside, ignored, that you don't want to delete.
- Then there is now a script that prints all source filenames, so you can more easily open
  them all in your editor.
- And very important, there is now a "check-release.sh" script that performs all the tests
  I think should be done before making a release.
- Pylint got more happy with the current Nuitka source. In some places, I added comments
  where rules should be granted exceptions.

Numbers
-------

python 2.6::

  Pystone(1.1) time for 50000 passes = 0.65
  This machine benchmarks at 76923.1 pystones/second

Nuitka 0.3.5 (driven by python 2.6)::

  Pystone(1.1) time for 50000 passes = 0.31
  This machine benchmarks at 161290 pystones/second

This is 109% for 0.3.5, up from 91% before.

Overall this release is primarily an improvement in the domain of compatibility and
contains important bug and feature fixes to the users. The optimization framework only
makes a first showing of with the framework to organize them. There is still work to do to
migrate optimizations previously present

It will take more time before we will see effect from these. I believe that even more
cleanups of "TreeBuilding", "Nodes" and "CodeGeneration" will be required, before
everything is in place for the big jump in performance numbers. But still, passing 100%
feels good. Time to rejoice.


Nuitka Release 0.3.4
====================

This new release of Nuitka has a focus on re-organizing the Nuitka generated source code
and a modest improvement on the performance side.

For a long time now, Nuitka has generated a single C++ file and asked the C++ compiler to
translate it to an executable or shared library for CPython to load. This was done even
when embedding many modules into one (the "deep" compilation mode, option "--deep").

This was simple to do and in theory ought to allow the compiler to do the most
optimizations. But for large programs, the resulting source code could have exponential
compile time behavior in the C++ compiler. At least for the GNU g++ this was the case,
others probably as well. This is of course at the end a scalability issue of Nuitka, which
now has been addressed.

So the major advancement of this release is to make the "--deep" option useful. But also
there have been a performance improvements, which end up giving us another boost for the
pystone benchmark.

Bug fixes
---------

- Imports of modules local to packages now work correctly, closing the small compatibility
  gap that was there.
- Modules with a "-" in the name are allowed in CPython. This lead to wrong C++ code
  created. (Thanks to Li Xuan Ji for reporting and submitting a patch to fix it.)
- There were warnings about wrong format used for "Ssize_t" type of CPython. (Again,
  thanks to Li Xuan Ji for reporting and submitting the patch to fix it.)
- When a wrong exception type is raised, the traceback should still be the one of the
  original one.
- Set and dict contractions (Python 2.7 features) declared local variables for global
  variables used. This went unnoticed, because list contractions don't generate code for
  local variables at all, as they cannot have such.
- Using the "type()" builtin to create a new class could attribute it to the wrong module,
  this is now corrected.

New Features
------------

- Uses Scons to execute the actual C++ build, giving some immediate improvements.
- Now caches build results and Scons will only rebuild as needed.
- The direct use of "__import__()" with a constant module name as parameter is also
  followed in "deep" mode. With time, non-constants may still become predictable, right
  now it must be a real CPython constant string.

New Optimizations
-----------------

- Added optimization for the builtins "ord()" and "chr()", these require a module and
  builtin module lookup, then parameter parsing. Now these are really quick with Nuitka.
- Added optimization for the "type()" builtin with one parameter. As above, using from
  builtin module can be very slow. Now it is instantaneous.
- Added optimization for the "type()" builtin with three parameters. It's rarely used, but
  providing our own variant, allowed to fix the bug mentioned above.

Cleanups
--------

- Using scons is a big cleanup for the way how C++ compiler related options are
  applied. It also makes it easier to re-build without Nuitka, e.g. if you were using
  Nuitka in your packages, you can easily build in the same way than Nuitka does.
- Static helpers source code has been moved to ".hpp" and ".cpp" files, instead of being
  in ".py" files. This makes C++ compiler messages more readable and allows us to use C++
  mode in Emacs etc., making it easier to write things.
- Generated code for each module ends up in a separate file per module or package.
- Constants etc. go to their own file (although not named sensible yet, likely going to
  change too)
- Module variables are now created by the "CPythonModule" node only and are unique, this
  is to make optimizations of these feasible. This is a pre-step to module variable
  optimizations.

New Tests
---------

- Added ExtremeClosure from my Python quiz, it was not covered by existing tests.
- Added test case for program that imports a module with a dash in its name.
- Added test case for main program that starts with a dash.
- Extended the builtin tests to cover "type()" as well.

Organizational
--------------

- There is now a new environment variable "NUITKA_SCONS" which should point to the
  directory with the "SingleExe.scons" file for Nuitka. The scons file could be named
  better, because it is actually one and the same who builds extension modules and
  executables.
- There is now a new environment variable "NUITKA_CPP" which should point to the directory
  with the C++ helper code of Nuitka.
- The "create-environment.sh" can now be sourced (if you are in the top level directory of
  Nuitka) or be used with eval. In either case it also reports what it does.
- To cleanup the many "Program.build" directories, there is now a "clean-up.sh" script for
  your use. Can be handy, but if you use git, you may prefer its clean command.

Numbers
-------

python 2.6::

  Pystone(1.1) time for 50000 passes = 0.65
  This machine benchmarks at 76923.1 pystones/second

Nuitka 0.3.4::

  Pystone(1.1) time for 50000 passes = 0.34
  This machine benchmarks at 147059 pystones/second

This is 91% for 0.3.4, up from 80% before.


Nuitka Release 0.3.3
====================

This release of Nuitka continues the focus on performance. It also cleans up a few open
topics. One is "doctests", these are now extracted from the CPython 2.6 test suite more
completely. The other is that the CPython 2.7 test suite is now passed completely. There
is some more work ahead though, to extract all of the "doctests" and to do that for both
versions of the tests.

This means an even higher level of compatibility has been achieved, then there is
performance improvements, and ever cleaner structure.

Bug fixes
---------

Generators
~~~~~~~~~~

- Generator functions tracked references to the common and the instance context
  independently, now the common context is not released before the instance contexts are.
- Generator functions didn't check the arguments to "throw()" the way they are in CPython,
  now they are.
- Generator functions didn't trace exceptions to "stderr" if they occurred while closing
  unfinished ones in "del".
- Generator functions used the slightly different wordings for some error messages.

Function Calls
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

- Extended call syntax with "\*\*" allows that to use a mapping, and it is now checked if
  it really is a mapping and if the contents has string keys.
- Similarly, extended call syntax with "\*" allows a sequence, it is now checked if it
  really is a sequence.
- Error message for duplicate keyword arguments or too little arguments now describe the
  duplicate parameter and the callable the same way CPython does.
- Now checks to the keyword argument list first before considering the parameter
  counts. This is slower in the error case, but more compatible with CPython.

Classes
~~~~~~~

- The "locals()" builtin when used in the class scope (not in a method) now is correctly
  writable and writes to it change the resulting class.
- Name mangling for private identifiers was not always done entirely correct.

Others
~~~~~~

- Exceptions didn't always have the correct stack reported.
- The pickling of some tuples showed that "cPickle" can have non-reproducible results,
  using "pickle" to stream constants now

Optimizations
-------------

- Access to instance attributes has become faster by writing specific code for the
  case. This is done in JIT way, attempting at run time to optimize attribute access for
  instances.
- Assignments now often consider what's cheaper for the other side, instead of taking a
  reference to a global variable, just to have to release it.
- The function call code built argument tuples and dictionaries as constants, now that is
  true for every tuple usage.

Cleanups
--------

- The static helper classes, and the prelude code needed have been moved to separate C++
  files and are now accessed "#include". This makes the code inside C++ files as opposed
  to a Python string and therefore easier to read and or change.

New Features
------------

- The generator functions and generator expressions have the attribute "gi_running"
  now. These indicate if they are currently running.

New Tests
---------

- The script to extract the "doctests" from the CPython test suite has been rewritten
  entirely and works with more doctests now. Running these tests created increased the
  test coverage a lot.
- The Python 2.7 test suite has been added.

Organizational
--------------

- One can now run multiple "compare_with_cpython" instances in parallel, which enables
  background test runs.
- There is now a new environment variable "NUITKA_INCLUDE" which needs to point to the
  directory Nuitka's C++ includes live in. Of course the "create-environment.sh" script
  generates that for you easily.

Numbers
-------

python 2.6::

  Pystone(1.1) time for 50000 passes = 0.65
  This machine benchmarks at 76923.1 pystones/second

Nuitka 0.3.3::

   Pystone(1.1) time for 50000 passes = 0.36
   This machine benchmarks at 138889 pystones/second

This is 80% for 0.3.3, up from 66% before.


Nuitka Release 0.3.2
====================

This release of Nuitka continues the focus on performance. But this release also revisits
the topic of feature parity. Before, feature parity had been reached "only" with Python
2.6. This is of course a big thing, but you know there is always more, e.g. Python 2.7.

With the addition of set contractions and dict contractions in this very release, Nuitka
is approaching Python support for 2.7, and then there are some bug fixes.

Bug fixes
---------

- Calling a function with "\*\*" and using a non-dict for it was leading to wrong
  behavior. Now a mapping is good enough as input for the "\*\*" parameter and it's
  checked.

- Deeply nested packages "package.subpackage.module" were not found and gave a warning
  from Nuitka, with the consequence that they were not embedded in the executable. They
  now are.

- Some error messages for wrong parameters didn't match literally. For example "function
  got multiple..." as opposed to "function() got multiple..." and alike.

- Files that ended in line with a "#" but without a new line gave an error from
  "ast.parse". As a workaround, a new line is added to the end of the file if it's
  "missing".

- More correct exception locations for complex code lines. I noted that the current line
  indication should not only be restored when the call at hand failed, but in any
  case. Otherwise sometimes the exception stack would not be correct. It now is - more
  often. Right now, this has no systematic test.

- Re-raised exceptions didn't appear on the stack if caught inside the same function,
  these are now correct.

- For exec the globals needs to have "__builtins__" added, but the check was performed
  with the mapping interface. That is not how CPython does it, and so e.g. the mapping
  could use a default value for "__builtins__" which could lead to incorrect
  behavior. Clearly a corner case, but one that works fully compatible now.

Optimizations
-------------

- The local and shared local variable C++ classes have a flag "free_value" to indicate if
  an "PY_DECREF" needs to be done when releasing the object. But still the code used
  "Py_XDECREF" (which allows for "NULL" values to be ignored.) when the releasing of the
  object was done. Now the inconsistency of using "NULL" as "object" value with
  "free_value" set to true was removed.

- Tuple constants were copied before using them without a point. They are immutable
  anyway.

Cleanups
--------

- Improved more of the indentation of the generated C++ which was not very good for
  contractions so far. Now it is. Also assignments should be better now.

- The generation of code for contractions was made more general and templates split into
  multiple parts. This enabled reuse of the code for list contractions in dictionary and
  set contractions.

- The with statement has its own template now and got cleaned up regarding indentation.

New Tests
---------

- There is now a script to extract the "doctests" from the CPython test suite and it
  generates Python source code from them. This can be compiled with Nuitka and output
  compared to CPython. Without this, the doctest parts of the CPython test suite is mostly
  useless. Solving this improved test coverage, leading to many small fixes. I will
  dedicate a later posting to the tool, maybe it is useful in other contexts as well.

- Reference count tests have been expanded to cover assignment to multiple assignment
  targets, and to attributes.

- The deep program test case, now also have a module in a sub-package to cover this case
  as well.

Organizational
--------------

- The `gitweb interface <http://nuitka.net/gitweb>`_ might be considered an alternative to
  downloading the source if you want to provide a pointer, or want to take a quick glance
  at the source code. You can already download with git, follow the link below to the page
  explaining it.

- The README.txt has documented more of the differences and I consequently updated the
  Differences page. There is now a distinction between generally missing functionality and
  things that don't work in "--deep" mode, where Nuitka is supposed to create one
  executable.

  I will make it a priority to remove the (minor) issues of "--deep" mode in the next
  release, as this is only relatively little work, and not a good difference to have. We
  want these to be empty, right? But for the time being, I document the known differences
  there.

Numbers
-------

python 2.6::

  Pystone(1.1) time for 50000 passes = 0.65
  This machine benchmarks at 76923.1 pystones/second

Nuitka 0.3.2::

  Pystone(1.1) time for 50000 passes = 0.39
  This machine benchmarks at 128205 pystones/second

This is 66% for 0.3.2, slightly up from the 58% of 0.3.1 before. The optimizations done
were somewhat fruitful, but as you can see, they were also more cleanups, not the big
things.


Nuitka Release 0.3.1
====================

This release of Nuitka continues the focus on performance and contains only cleanups and
optimizations. Most go into the direction of more readable code, some aim at making the
basic things faster, with good results as to performance as you can see below.

Optimizations
-------------

- Constants in conditions of conditional expressions ("a if cond else d"), "if"/"elif" or
  "while" are now evaluated to "true" or "false" directly. Before there would be temporary
  python object created from it which was then checked if it was "True".

  All of that is obviously overhead only. And it hurts the typically "while 1:" infinite
  loop case badly.

- Do not generate code to catch "BreakException" or "ContinueException" unless a "break"
  or "continue" statement being in a "try: finally:" block inside that loop actually
  require this.

  Even while uncaught exceptions are cheap, it is still an improvement worthwhile and it
  clearly improves the readability for the normal case.

- The compiler more aggressively prepares tuples, lists and dicts from the source code as
  constants if their contents is "immutable" instead of building at run time. An example
  of a "mutable" tuple would be "( {}, )" which is not safe to share, and therefore will
  still be built at run time.

  For dictionaries and lists, copies will be made, under the assumption that copying a
  dictionary will always be faster, than making it from scratch.

- The parameter parsing code was dynamically building the tuple of argument names to check
  if an argument name was allowed by checking the equivalent of "name in
  argument_names". This was of course wasteful and now a pre-built constant is used for
  this, so it should be much faster to call functions with keyword arguments.

- There are new templates files and also actual templates now for the "while" and "for"
  loop code generation. And I started work on having a template for assignments.

Cleanups
--------

- Do not generate code for the else of "while" and "for" loops if there is no such
  branch. This uncluttered the generated code somewhat.

- The indentation of the generated C++ was not very good and whitespace was often
  trailing, or e.g. a real tab was used instead of "\t". Some things didn't play well
  together here.

  Now much of the generated C++ code is much more readable and whitespace cleaner. For
  optimizations to be done, the humans need to be able to read the generated code
  too. Mind you, the aim is not to produce usable C++, but on the other hand, it must be
  possible to understand it.

- To the same end of readability, the empty "else {}" branches are avoided for "if",
  "while" and "for" loops. While the C++ compiler can be expected to remove these, they
  seriously cluttered up things.

- The constant management code in "Context" was largely simplified. Now the code is using
  the "Constant" class to find its way around the problem that dicts, sets, etc. are not
  hashable, or that "complex" is not being ordered; this was necessary to allow deeply
  nested constants, but it is also a simpler code now.

- The C++ code generated for functions now has two entry points, one for Python calls
  (arguments as a list and dictionary for parsing) and one where this has happened
  successfully. In the future this should allow for faster function calls avoiding the
  building of argument tuples and dictionaries all-together.

- For every function there was a "traceback adder" which was only used in the C++
  exception handling before exit to CPython to add to the traceback object. This was now
  inlined, as it won't be shared ever.

Numbers

python 2.6::

  Pystone(1.1) time for 50000 passes = 0.65
  This machine benchmarks at 76923.1 pystones/second

Nuitka 0.3.1::

  Pystone(1.1) time for 50000 passes = 0.41
  This machine benchmarks at 121951 pystones/second
  This is 58% for 0.3.1, up from the 25% before. So it's getting somewhere. As always you will find its latest version here.


Nuitka Release 0.3.0
====================

This release 0.3.0 is the first release to focus on performance. In the 0.2.x series
Nuitka achieved feature parity with CPython 2.6 and that was very important, but now it is
time to make it really useful.

Optimization has been one of the main points, although I was also a bit forward looking to
Python 2.7 language constructs. This release is the first where I really started to
measure things and removed the most important bottlenecks.

New Features
------------

- Added option to control "--debug". With this option the C++ debug information is present
  in the file, otherwise it is not. This will give much smaller ".so" and ".exe" files
  than before.
- Added option "--no-optimization" to disable all optimizations. It enables C++ asserts
  and compiles with less aggressive C++ compiler optimization, so it can be used for
  debugging purposes.
- Support for Python 2.7 set literals has been added.

Performance Enhancements
------------------------

- Fast global variables: Reads of global variables were fast already. This was due to a
  trick that is now also used to check them and to do a much quicker update if they are
  already set.

- Fast break/continue statements: To make sure these statements execute the finally
  handlers if inside a try, these used C++ exceptions that were caught by try/finally and
  while/for loops.

  This was very slow and had very bad performance. Now it is checked if this is at all
  necessary and then it's only done for the rare case where a break/continue really is
  inside the tried block. Otherwise it is now translated to a C++ "break/continue" which
  the C++ compiler handles more efficiently.

- Added "unlikely()" compiler hints to all errors handling cases to allow the C++ compiler
  to generate more efficient branch code.
- The for loop code was using an exception handler to make sure the iterated value was
  released, using "PyObjectTemporary" for that instead now, which should lead to better
  generated code.
- Using constant dictionaries and copy from them instead of building them at run time even
  when contents was constant.

New Tests
---------

- Merged some bits from the CPython 2.7 test suite that do not harm 2.6, but generally
  it's a lot due to some "unittest" module interface changes.
- Added CPython 2.7 tests "test_dictcomps.py" and "test_dictviews.py" which both pass when
  using Python 2.7
- Added another benchmark extract from pystone.py which uses a while loop with break

Numbers
-------

python 2.6::

  Pystone(1.1) time for 50000 passes = 0.65
  This machine benchmarks at 76923.1 pystones/second

Nuitka 0.3.0::

  Pystone(1.1) time for 50000 passes = 0.52
  This machine benchmarks at 96153.8 pystones/second

That's a 25% speedup now and a good start clearly. It's not yet in the range of where i
want it to be, but there is always room for more. And the "break/continue" exception was
an important performance regression fix.


Nuitka Release 0.2.4
====================

This release 0.2.4 is likely the last 0.2.x release, as it's the one that achieved feature
parity with CPython 2.6, which was the whole point of the release series, so time to
celebrate. I have stayed away (mostly) from any optimizations, so as to not be premature.

From now on speed optimization is going to be the focus though. Because right now,
frankly, there is not much of a point to use Nuitka yet, with only a minor run time speed
gain in trade for a long compile time. But hopefully we can change that quickly now.

New Features
------------

- The use of exec in a local function now adds local variables to scope it is in.
- The same applies to "from module_name import \*" which is now compiled correctly and adds
  variables to the local variables.

Bug Fixes
---------

- Raises "UnboundLocalError" when deleting a local variable with "del" twice.
- Raises "NameError" when deleting a global variable with "del" twice.
- Read of to uninitialized closure variables gave "NameError", but "UnboundLocalError" is
  correct and raised now.

Cleanups
--------

- There is now a dedicated pass over the node tree right before code generation starts, so
  that some analysis can be done as late as that. Currently this is used for determining
  which functions should have a dictionary of locals.
- Checking the exported symbols list, fixed all the cases where a "static" was
  missing. This reduces the "module.so" sizes.
- With gcc the "visibility=hidden" is used to avoid exporting the helper classes. Also
  reduces the "module.so" sizes, because classes cannot be made static otherwise.

New Tests
---------

- Added "DoubleDeletions" to cover behaviour of "del". It seems that this is not part of
  the CPython test suite.
- The "OverflowFunctions" (those with dynamic local variables) now has an interesting
  test, exec on a local scope, effectively adding a local variable while a closure
  variable is still accessible, and a module variable too. This is also not in the CPython
  test suite.
- Restored the parts of the CPython test suite that did local star imports or exec to
  provide new variables. Previously these have been removed.
- Also "test_with.py" which covers PEP 343 has been reactivated, the with statement works
  as expected.


Nuitka Release 0.2.3
====================

This new release is marking a closing in on feature parity to CPython 2.6 which is an
important mile stone. Once this is reached, a "Nuitka 0.3.x" series will strive for
performance.

Bug Fixes
---------

- Generator functions no longer leak references when started, but not finished.
- Yield can in fact be used as an expression and returns values that the generator user
  "send()" to it.

Reduced Differences / New Features
----------------------------------

- Generator functions already worked quite fine, but now they have the "throw()", "send()"
  and "close()" methods.
- Yield is now an expression as is ought to be, it returns values put in by "send()" on
  the generator user.
- Support for extended slices:

.. code-block:: python

   x = d[:42, ..., :24:, 24, 100]
   d[:42, ..., :24:, 24, 100] = "Strange"
   del d[:42, ..., :24:, 24, 100]

Tests Work
----------

- The "test_contextlib" is now working perfectly due to the generator functions having a
  correct "throw()". Added that test back, so context managers are now fully covered.
- Added a basic test for "overflow functions" has been added, these are the ones which
  have an unknown number of locals due to the use of language constructs "exec" or "from
  bla import \*" on the function level. This one currently only highlights the failure to
  support it.
- Reverted removals of extended slice syntax from some parts of the CPython test suite.

Cleanups
--------

- The compiled generator types are using the new C++0x type safe enums feature.
- Resolved a circular dependency between "TreeBuilding" and "TreeTransforming" modules.



Nuitka Release 0.2.2
====================

This is some significant progress, a lot of important things were addressed.

Bug Fixes
---------

- Scope analysis is now done during the tree building instead of sometimes during code
  generation, this fixed a few issues that didnt show up in tests previously.
- Reference leaks of generator expressions that were not fishing, but then deleted are not
  more.
- Inlining of exec is more correct now.
- More accurate exception lines when iterator creation executes compiled code, e.g. in a
  for loop
- The list of base classes of a class was evaluated in the context of the class, now it is
  done in the context of the containing scope.
- The first iterated of a generator expression was evaluated in its own context, now it is
  done in the context of the containing scope.

Reduced Differences
-------------------

- With the enhanced scope analysis, UnboundLocalError is now correctly supported.
- Generator expressions (but not yet functions) have a "throw()", "send()" and "close()"
  method.
- Exec can now write to local function namespace even if "None" is provided at run time.
- Relative imports inside packages are now correctly resolved at compile time when using
  "--deep".

Cleanups
--------

- The compiled function type got further enhanced and cleaned up.
- The compiled generator expression function type lead to a massive cleanup of the code
  for generator expressions.
- Cleaned up namespaces, was still using old names, or "Py*" which is reserved to core
  CPython.
- Overhaul of the code responsible for "eval" and "exec", it has been split, and it pushed
  the detection defaults to the C++ compiler which means, we can do it at run time or
  compile time, depending on circumstances.
- Made "PyTemporaryObject" safer to use, disabling copy constructor it should be also a
  relief to the C++ compiler if it doesn't have to eliminate all its uses.
- The way delayed work is handled in "TreeBuilding" step has been changed to use closured
  functions, should be more readable.
- Some more code templates have been created, making the code generation more readable in
  some parts. More to come.

Optimizations / New Features
----------------------------

- Name lookups for "None", "True" and "False" and now always detected as constants,
  eliminating many useless module variable lookups.
- As I start to consider announcing Nuitka, I moved the version logic so that the version
  can now be queries with "--version"
- More complete test of generator expressions.
- Added test program for packages with relative imports inside the package.
- The builtin "dir()" in a function was not having fully deterministic output list, now it
  does.

Summary
-------

Overall, the amount of differences between CPython and Nuitka is heading towards
zero. Also most of the improvements done in this release were very straightforward
cleanups and not much work was required, mostly things are about cleanups and then it
becomes easily right. The new type for the compiled generator expressions was simple to
create, esp. as I could check what CPython does in its source code.

For optimization purposes, I decided that generator expressions and generator functions
will be separate compiled types, as most of their behavior will not be shared. I believe
optimizing generator expressions to run well is an important enough goal to warrant that
they have their own implementation. Now that this is done, I will repeat it with generator
functions.

Generator functions already work quite fine, but like generator expressions did before
this release, they can leak references if not finished , and they dont have the "throw()"
method, which seems very important to the correct operation of "contextlib". So I will
introduce a decicated type for these too, possibly in the next release.

Nuitka Release 0.2.1
====================

The march goes on, this is another minor release with a bunch of substantial improvements:

Bug Fixes
---------

- Packages now also can be embedded with the "--deep" option too, before they could not be
  imported from the executable.
- Inlined exec with their own future statements leaked these to the surrounding code.

Reduced Differences
-------------------

- The future print function import is now supported too.

Cleanups
--------

- Independence of the compiled function type. When I started it was merely "PyCFunction"
  and then a copy of it patched at run time, using increasingly less code from
  CPython. Now it's nothing at all anymore.

- This lead to major cleanup of run time compiled function creation code, no more
  "methoddefs", "PyCObject" holding context, etc.

- PyLint was used to find the more important style issues and potential bugs, also helping
  to identify some dead code.

Summary
-------

The major difference now is the lack of a throw method for generator functions. I will try
to address that in a 0.2.2 release if possible. The plan is that the 0.2.x series will
complete these tasks, and 0.3 could aim at some basic optimizations finally.


Nuitka Release 0.2
==================

Good day, this is a major step ahead, improvements everywhere.

Bug fixes
---------

- Migrated the Python parser from the deprecated and problematic "compiler" module to the
  "ast" module which fixes the "d[a,] = b" parser problem. A pity it was not available at
  the time I started, but the migration was relatively painless now.
- I found and fixed wrong encoding of binary data into C++ literals. Now Nuitka uses C++0x
  raw strings, and these problems are gone.
- The decoding of constants was done with the "marshal" module, but that appears to not
  deeply care enough about unicode encoding it seems. Using "cPickle" now, which seems
  less efficient, but is more correct.
- Another difference is gone: The "continue" and "break" inside loops do no longer prevent
  the execution of finally blocks inside the loop.

Project Management
------------------

- I now maintain the README.txt in org-mode, and intend to use it as the issue tracker,
  but I am still a beginner at that.

  .. admonition:: Update

     Turned out I never master it, and used ReStructured Text instead.

- There is a public git repository for you to track Nuitka releases. Make your changes and
  then "git pull --rebase". If you encounter conflicts in things you consider useful,
  please submit the patches and a pull offer. When you make your clones of Nuitka public,
  use "nuitka-unofficial" or not the name "Nuitka" at all.

- There is a now a `mailing list
  <http://nuitka.net/blog/nuitka-a-python-compiler/nuitka-mailinglist/>`_ available too.

Reduced Differences
-------------------

- Did you know you could write "lambda : (yield something)" and it gives you a lambda that
  creates a generator that produces that one value? Well, now Nuitka has support for
  lambda generator functions.

- The "from __future__ import division" statement works as expected now, leading to some
  newly passing CPython tests.

- Same for "from __future__ import unicode_literals" statement, these work as expected
  now, removing many differences in the CPython tests that use this already.

New Features
------------

- The "Python" binary provided and "Nuitka.py" are now capable of accepting parameters for
  the program executed, in order to make it even more of a dropin replacement to "python".

- Inling of exec statements with constant expressions. These are now compiled at compile
  time, not at run time anymore. I observed that an increasing number of CPython tests use
  exec to do things in isolation or to avoid warnings, and many more these tests will now
  be more effective. I intend to do the same with eval expressions too, probably in a
  minor release.

Summary
-------

So give it a whirl. I consider it to be substantially better than before, and the list of
differences to CPython is getting small enough, plus there is already a fair bit of polish
to it. Just watch out that it needs gcc-4.5 or higher now.


Nuitka Release 0.1.1
====================

I just have just updated Nuitka to version 0.1.1 which is a bug fix release to 0.1, which
corrects many of the small things:

- Updated the CPython test suite to 2.6.6rc, minimized much of existing differences
- Compile standalone executables that includes modules (with --deep option), but packages
  are not yet included successfully.
- Reference leaks with exceptions are no more
- sys.exc_info() works now mostly as expected (it's not a stack of exceptions)
- More readable generated code, better organisation of C++ template code
- Restored debug option --g++-only

The biggest thing probably is the progress with exception tracebacks objects in exception
handlers, which were not there before (always "None"). Having these in place will make it
much more compatible. Also with manually raised exceptions and assertions, tracebacks will
now be more correct to the line.

On a bad news, I discovered that the "compiler" module that I use to create the AST from
Python source code, is not only deprecated, but also broken. I created the `CPython bug
<http://bugs.python.org/issue9656>`_ about it, basically it cannot distinguish some code
of the form d[1,] = None from d[1] = None. This will require a migration of the "ast"
module, which should not be too challenging, but will take some time.

I am aiming at it for a 0.2 release. Generating wrong code (Nuitka sees d[1] = None in
both cases) is a show blocker and needs a solution.

So, yeah. It's better, it's there, but still experimental. You will find its latest version here. Please try it out and let me know what you think in the comments section.


Nuitka Release 0.1 (Releasing Nuitka to the World)
==================================================

Obviously this is very exciting step for me. I am releasing Nuitka today. Finally. For a
long time I knew I would, but actually doing it, is a different beast. Reaching my goals
for release turned out to be less far away than I hope, so instead of end of August, I can
already release it now.

Currently it's not more than 4% faster than CPython. No surprise there, if all you did, is
removing the bytecode interpretation so far. It's not impressive at all. It's not even a
reason to use it. But it's also only a start. Clearly, once I get into optimizing the code
generation of Nuitka, it will only get better, and then probably in sometimes dramatic
steps. But I see this as a long term goal.

I want to have infrastructure in the code place, before doing lots of possible
optimizations that just make Nuitka unmaintainable. And I will want to have a look at what
others did so far in the domain of type inference and how to apply that for my project.

I look forward to the reactions about getting this far. The supported language volume is amazing, and I have a set of nice tricks used. For example the way generator functions are done is a clever hack.

Where to go from here? Well, I guess, I am going to judge it by the feedback I receive. I
personally see "constant propagation" as a laudable first low hanging fruit, that could be
solved.

Consider this readable code on the module level:

.. code-block:: python

    meters_per_nautical_mile = 1852

    def convertMetersToNauticalMiles( meters ):
        return meters / meters_per_nautical_mile
    def convertNauticalMilesToMeters( miles ):
        return miles * meters_per_nautical_mile

Now imagine you are using this very frequently in code. Quickly you determine that the
following will be much faster:

.. code-block:: python

    def convertMetersToNauticalMiles( meters ):
        return meters / 1852
    def convertNauticalMilesToMeters( miles ):
        return miles * 1852

Still good? Well, probably next step you are going to inline the function calls
entirely. For optimization, you are making your code less readable. I do not all
appreciate that. My first goal is there to make the more readable code perform as well or
better as the less readable variant.

======================================

Background: Nuitka Plugins
--------------------------------------
Plugins are a feature to modify the way how Nuitka compiles Python programs in
extremely flexible ways.

Plugins can automatically include data files and additional shared libraries,
import modules not detectable by source code examination,
modify or extend the to-be-compiled source code, gather statistics, change
Nuitka's parameter defaults and much more.

Any number of plugins may be used in each compilation.

Plugins come in two variants: **standard** plugins and **user** plugins.

User plugins are not part of the Nuitka package: they must be provided otherwise. To use them in a compilation, Nuitka must be able to find them using their path / filename. If user plugins are specified, Nuitka will activate them **before** it activates any of its standard plugins.

.. |ups| replace:: user plugins

.. |sps| replace:: standard plugins

.. |ops| replace:: optional standard plugins

Standard plugins are part of the Nuitka package and are therefore always available.

Nuitka also differentiates between "mandatory" and "optional" |sps|.

**Mandatory** |sps| will be enabled automatically in every compilation and are thus "invisible" to the user. Their behaviour cannot be influenced other than by changing their source code.

**Optional** |sps| must be enabled via the command line parameter ``--enable-plugin=name``, with an identifying string ``name``. However, even when not enabled, |ops| can detect, whether their use might have been "forgotten" and issue an appropriate warning.

Where appropriate, the behaviour of optional |sps| (like with |ups|) can be controlled via options (see "Using Plugin Options").

A Word of Caution
---------------------
Specifying required |ops| is up to the user. Specifically for standalone compilation, selecting the right |ops| determines success.

* While |ups| are able to programmatically enable |ops|, standard plugins technically **cannot do this**. The user must know the requirements of his script and specify all appropriate |ops|, including any required options (see below).
* There is currently no way to automatically react to any interdependencies. For example, when compiling a script using the ``tensorflow`` package in ``--standalone`` mode, you must enable (at least) both, the ``tensorflow`` **and** the ``numpy`` plugin. Similar is true for ``scikit-learn`` users: they must also enable the ``numpy`` plugin using its ``scipy`` option.
* For Nuitka, there is no way knowing from source code analysis, whether a script will **actually use** a module for which it finds an ``import`` statement (and potentially even which parts of it). This knowledge must be provided to the compile command -- by specifying plugins and potentially plugin options.

In `this <https://github.com/Nuitka/NUITKA-Utilities/tree/master/hinted-compilation>`_ repository folder you will find ways which automate the correct and complete specification of |ops|.

****************************
 Background: Nuitka Plugins
****************************

Plugins are a feature to modify the way how Nuitka compiles Python
programs in extremely flexible ways.

Plugins can automatically include data files and additional shared
libraries, import modules which are not detectable by source code
analysis, modify or extend the to-be-compiled source code, gather
statistics, change Nuitka's parameter defaults and much more.

Any number of plugins may be used in each compilation.

Plugins come in two variants: **standard** plugins and **user** plugins.

User plugins are not part of the Nuitka package: they must be provided
otherwise. To use them in a compilation, Nuitka must be able to find
them using their path / filename. If |ups| are specified, Nuitka will
activate them **before** it activates any of its standard plugins.

Standard plugins are part of the Nuitka package and thus always
available.

Nuitka also differentiates between "mandatory" and "optional" |sps|.

**Mandatory** |sps| are always enabled and "invisible" to the user.
Their behaviour cannot be influenced other than by modifying them.

**Optional** |sps| must be enabled via the command line parameter
``--plugin-enable-=name``, with an identifying string ``name``. Even
when not enabled however, |ops| can detect, whether their use might have
been "forgotten" and issue an appropriate warning.

Where appropriate, the behaviour of optional |sps| (like with |ups|) can
be controlled via *options* (see "Using Plugin Options").

*******************
 A Word of Caution
*******************

Almost all |ops| are relevant for standalone mode only. Specifying all
the right plugins is up to the user and critical for success: for
example. if you are using package *numpy* and forget to activate that
plugin, then your compile will

   -  end with no error, but a warning about missing numpy support,
   -  not generate a working binary.

-  |ups| are able to programmatically enable |ops|, the **reverse is not
   possible**. The user must know the requirements of his script and
   specify all appropriate |ops|, including any required *options* (see
   below).

-  There is currently no way to automatically react to
   interdependencies. For example, when compiling a script using the
   *tensorflow* package in standalone mode, you must enable (at least)
   **both**, the ``tensorflow`` **and** the ``numpy`` plugin.

-  Like every compiler, Nuitka cannot always decide, whether a script
   will **actually execute** an *import* statement. This knowledge must
   be provided by you via specifying plugins.

In `this
<https://github.com/Nuitka/NUITKA-Utilities/tree/master/hinted-compilation>`_
repository folder you find help to address the above points of caution.
These tools provide *runtime information* of your program to the Nuitka
compiler, such that all required plugins are activated automatically,
and only used packages are included.

*****************************************
 Optional Standard Plugins Documentation
*****************************************

dill-compat
===========

-  Required by the *dill* module. Dill extends Python's pickle module
   for serializing and de-serializing objects.
-  Options: none.

eventlet
========

-  Required by the *eventlet* package. Eventlet is a concurrent
   networking library.
-  Options: none.

gevent
======

-  Required by the *gevent* package. Gevent is a coroutine-based Python
   networking library that uses greenlet to provide a high-level
   synchronous API.

-  Options: none.

numpy
=====

-  Required for *numpy, scipy, pandas, matplotlib, xarray, sklearn,
   skimage*, and most other scientific packages.
-  Options: "scipy", "matplotlib" if used. E.g. ``--plugin-enable=numpy
   --include-scipy --include-matplotlib``.

pmw-freezer
===========

-  Required by the *Pmw* package. Pmw is a toolkit for building
   high-level compound widgets.
-  Options: none.

pylint-warnings
===============

-  Support *PyLint* / *PyDev* linting source markers. Python static code
   analysis tools which help enforcing a coding standard.
-  Options: none

qt-plugins
==========

-  Required by the *PyQt* and *PySide* GUI packages.
-  Options: "sensible", "styles", "qml", "xml", "all", where "sensible"
   means the default minimum set of Qt features.

tensorflow
==========

-  Required by the *tensorflow* package. TensorFlow is an open source
   machine learning framework for everyone. Note that this package
   requires *numpy* and potentially many other packages.

-  Options: none.

tk-inter
========

-  Required by Python's Tk modules.
-  Options: none.

torch
=====

-  Required by the *torch* and *torchvision* packages. Tensors and
   Dynamic neural networks in Python with strong GPU acceleration.
   *Torchvision* requires *numpy*.

-  Options: none.

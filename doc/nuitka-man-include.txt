[EXAMPLES]

Compile a Python file "some_module.py" to a module "some_module.so":
.IP
\f(CW$ nuitka \-\-module some_module.py\fR
.PP
Compile a Python program "some_program.py" to an executable "some_program.exe":
.IP
\f(CW$ nuitka some_program.py\fR
.PP
Compile a Python program "some_program.py" and the package "some_package" it
uses to an executable "some_program.exe":
.IP
\f(CW$ nuitka \-\-recurse\-to=some_package some_program.py\fR
.PP
Compile a Python program "some_program.py" and all the modules it uses to an executable "some_program.exe". Then execute it immediately when ready:
.IP
\f(CW$ nuitka \-\-run \-\-recurse\-all some_program.py\fR
.PP
Compile a Python program "some_program.py" and the modules it uses (even standard library) to an executable "some_program.exe":
.IP
\f(CW$ nuitka \-\-recurse\-all \-\-recurse\-stdlib some_program.py\fR
.PP
Compile a Python program "some_program.py" and the modules it uses to an executable "some_program.exe". Keep the debug information, so valgrind, gdb, etc. work
nicely.

Note: This will *not* degrade performance:
.IP
\f(CW$ nuitka \-\-unstriped \-\-recurse\-all some_program.py\fR
.PP
Compile a Python program "some_program.py" and the modules it uses to an executable "some_program.exe". Perform all kinds of checks about correctness of the generated
C and run\-time checks.

Note: This will degrade performance and should only be used to debug Nuitka:
.IP
\f(CW$ nuitka \-\-debug \-\-recurse\-all some_program.py\fR
.PP
Compile a Python program "some_program.py" and the modules it uses to an executable "some_program.exe". Perform all kinds of checks about correctness of the generated
C and run\-time checks. Also use the debug Python library, which does its own checks.

Note: This will degrade performance and should only be used to debug Nuitka:
.IP
\f(CW$ nuitka \-\-debug \-\-python-debug \-\-recurse\-all some_program.py\fR
.PP
Compile a Python program "some_program.py" and the plugins modules it loads at run time to an executable "some_program.exe":
.IP
\f(CW$ nuitka \-\-recurse\-all \-\-recurse\-directory=plugins_dir some_program.py\fR
.PP

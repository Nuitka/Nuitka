Overview
========

This document is the recommended first read if you are interested in using
Nuitka, understand its use cases, check what you can expect, license,
requirements, credits, etc.

Nuitka is **the** Python compiler. It is a seamless replacement or extension
to the Python interpreter and compiles **every** construct that CPython 2.6,
2.7, 3.3, 3.4, 3.5, 3.6, and 3.7 have, when itself run with that Python version.

It then executes uncompiled code, and compiled code together in an extremely
compatible manner.

You can use all Python library modules or and all extension modules freely.

It translates the Python into a C level program that then uses "libpython" to
execute in the same way as CPython does. All optimization is aimed at avoiding
overhead, where it's unnecessary. None is aimed at removing compatibility,
although slight improvements will occasionally be done, where not every bug
of standard Python is emulated, e.g. more complete error messages are given,
but there is a full compatibility mode to disable even that.


Usage
=====

Requirements
------------

- C Compiler: You need a compiler with support for C11 or alternatively
  for C++03 [#]_

  Currently this means, you need to use one of these compilers:

  * `The ``gcc`` compiler of at least version 5.1, or the ``g++`` compiler of
    at least version 4.4 as an alternative.

  * The ``clang`` compiler on MacOS X or FreeBSD.

  * The MinGW64 [#]_ C11 compiler on Windows, ideally the one based on gcc
    6 or higher.

  * Visual Studio 2017 or higher on Windows [#]_, older versions may work,
    but are not officially supported. Configure to use English language
    pack for best results (Nuitka filters away garbage outputs, but only
    for that language).

  * On Windows the ``clang-cl`` compiler on Windows can be used if provided if
    you use the ``CC`` environmentvariable to point to it, *and* you also have MSVC installed.


- Python: Version 2.6, 2.7 or 3.3, 3.4, 3.5, 3.6, 3.7

  .. admonition:: Python3, but for 3.3, and 3.4 and *only* those versions,
     we need other Python versions as a *compile time* dependency

     Nuitka itself is fully compatible with all mentioned versions, Scons as
     as an internally used tool is not.

     For these versions, you *need* a Python2 or Python 3.5 or higher installed
     as well, but only during the compile time only. That is for use with Scons
     (which orchestrates the C compilation), which does not support the same
     Python versions as Nuitka.

  .. admonition:: Moving binaries to other machines

     The created binaries can be made executable independent of the Python
     installation, with ``--standalone`` option.

  .. admonition:: Binary filename suffix

     The created binaries have an ``.exe`` suffix on Windows. On other platforms
     they have no suffix for standalone mode, or ``.bin`` suffix, that you ar
     free to remove or change, or specify with the ``-o`` option.

     The suffix for acceleration mode is added just to be sure that the original
     script name and the binary name do not ever collide, so we can safely do
     an overwrite without destroying the original source file.

  .. admonition:: It **has to** be CPython, AnaConda or MiniConda Python.

     You need the standard Python implementation, called "CPython", to execute
     Nuitka, because it is closely tied to implementation details of it.

     On Windows, for Python not installed system wide and acceleration mode, you
     need to copy the ``PythonXX.DLL`` alongside of it, something Nuitka does
     automatically.

     It is known that MacOS "pyenv" does **not** work.

- Operating System: Linux, FreeBSD, NetBSD, MacOS X, and Windows (32/64 bits).

  Others may work as well. The portability is expected to be generally good, but
  the e.g. Scons usage may have to be adapted. Make sure to match Windows Python
  and C compiler architecture, or else you will get cryptic error messages.

- Architectures: x86, x86_64 (amd64), and arm, likely many more

  Other architectures are expected to also work, out of the box, as Nuitka is
  generally not using any hardware specifics. These are just the ones tested
  and known to be good. Feedback is welcome. Generally the architectures that
  Debian supports can be considered good and tested too.

.. [#] Support for this C11 is a given with gcc 5 or higher or any clang
       version. The MSVC compiler doesn't do it yet. But as a workaround,
       as the C++03 language standard is very overlapping with C11, it is then
       used instead where the C compiler is too old. Nuitka used to require a
       C++ compiler in the past, but it changed.

.. [#] Download MinGW64 from here http://mingw-w64.org/ and choose 64 or 32
       bits matching your Python. Use both MinGW64 and 64 bits Python if you
       have the choice of which Python to use. Install it to ``C:\MinGW64`` or
       ``\MinGW64`` (same disk root as Nuitka running) to find it automatically.
       Also, when prompted, use "posix" for threads and "dwarf" for exception
       model, although these currently do not matter at all.

.. [#] Download for free from
       http://www.visualstudio.com/en-us/downloads/download-visual-studio-vs.aspx
       (the Express editions work just fine). The latest version is recommended
       if not required. There is no need to use older versions, they might in
       fact not work.


Command Line
------------

The recommended way of executing Nuitka is ``<the_right_python> -m nuitka`` to
be absolutely certain which Python interpreter you are using, so it is easier
to match with what Nuitka has.

The next best way of executing Nuitka bare that is from a source checkout or
archive, with no environment variable changes, most noteworthy, you do not
have to mess with ``PYTHONPATH`` at all for Nuitka. You just execute the
``nuitka`` and ``nuitka-run`` scripts directly without any changes to the
environment. You may want to add the ``bin`` directory to your ``PATH`` for
your convenience, but that step is optional.

Moreover, if you want to execute with the right interpreter in that case, be
sure to execute ``<the_right_python> bin/nuitka`` and be good.

  .. admonition:: Pick the right Interpreter

     If you encounter a ``SyntaxError`` you absolutely most certainly have
     picked the wrong interpreter for the program you are compiling.

Nuitka has a ``--help`` option to output what it can do:

.. code-block:: bash

    nuitka --help

The ``nuitka-run`` command is the same as ``nuitka``, but with different
default. It tries to compile *and* directly execute a Python script:

.. code-block:: bash

    nuitka-run --help

These option that is different is ``--run``, and passing on arguments after the
first non-option to the created binary, so it is somewhat more similar to what
plain ``python`` will do.

Use Cases
=========

Use Case 1 - Program compilation with all modules embedded
----------------------------------------------------------

If you want to compile a whole program recursively, and not only the single file
that is the main program, do it like this:

.. code-block:: bash

    python -m nuitka --follow-imports program.py

.. note::

   There are more fine grained controls than ``--follow-imports`` available.
   Consider the output of ``nuitka --help``.

In case you have a plugin directory, i.e. one which cannot be found by recursing
after normal import statements via the ``PYTHONPATH`` (which would be the
recommended way), you can always require that a given directory shall also be
included in the executable:

.. code-block:: bash

    python -m nuitka --follow-imports --include-plugin-directory=plugin_dir program.py

.. note::

   If you don't do any dynamic imports, simply setting your ``PYTHONPATH`` at
   compilation time will be sufficient for all your needs normally.

   Use ``--include-plugin-directory`` only if you make ``__import__()`` calls
   that Nuitka cannot predict, because they e.g. depend on command line
   parameters. Nuitka also warns about these, and point to the option.

.. note::

   The resulting filename will be ``program.exe`` on Windows, ``program.bin``
   on other platforms.

.. note::

   The resulting binary still depends on CPython and used C extension modules
   being installed.

   If you want to be able to copy it to another machine, use ``--standalone``
   and copy the created ``program.dist`` directory and execute the
   ``program.exe`` (Windows) or ``program`` (other platforms) put inside.


Use Case 2 - Extension Module compilation
-----------------------------------------

If you want to compile a single extension module, all you have to do is this:

.. code-block:: bash

    python -m nuitka --module some_module.py

The resulting file ``some_module.so`` can then be used instead of
``some_module.py``.

.. note::

   It's left as an exercise to the reader, to find out what happens if both are present.

.. note::

   The option ``--follow-imports`` and other variants work as well, but the
   included modules will only become importable *after* you imported the
   ``some_module`` name.

Use Case 3 - Package compilation
--------------------------------

If you need to compile a whole package and embed all modules, that is also
feasible, use Nuitka like this:

.. code-block:: bash

    python -m nuitka --module some_package --include-package=some_package

.. note::

   The recursion into the package directory needs to be provided manually,
   otherwise the package is empty. Data files located inside the package will
   not be embedded yet.

Tips
====

Caching
-------

The C compiler when invoked with the same input files will take a long time
and much CPU to compile. Make sure you are having ``ccache`` installed and
configured on non-Windows. It will make repeated compilations much faster,
even if things are not yet not perfect, i.e. changes to the program can
cause many C files to change, requiring a new compilation instead of using
the cached result.

On Windows, Nuitka supports using ``ccache.exe`` which is not easy to come
by though for the non-MSVC compilers, and ``clcache.exe`` which is just one
``pip install clcache`` command away. To make Nuitka use those, set either
``NUITKA_CCACHE_BINARY`` to the full path of ``ccache.exe`` or
``NUITKA_CLCACHE_BINARY`` to the full path of ``clcache.exe``, which will be
in the scripts folder of the Python you installed it into.

Runners
-------

Avoid running the ``nuitka`` binary, doing ``python -m nuitka`` will make a
100% sure you are using what you think you are.

Fastest C Compilers
-------------------

The fastest binaries of ``pystone.exe`` on Windows with 64 bits Python proved
to be signicantly faster with MinGW64, roughly 20% better score. So it is
recommended for use over MSVC. Using ``clang-cl.exe`` of Clang7 was faster
than MSVC, but still significantly slower than MinGW64, and it will be harder
to use, so it is not recommended.

On Linux for ``pystone.bin`` the binary produced by ``clang6`` was faster
than ``gcc-6.3``, but not by a significant margin. Since gcc is more often
already installed, that is recommended to use for now.

Differences in C compilation times have not yet been examined.

Where to go next
================

Remember, this project is not completed yet. Although the CPython test suite
works near perfect, there is still more work needed, esp. to make it do more
optimization. Try it out.

Subscribe to its mailing lists
------------------------------

Please visit the `mailing list page
<http://www.nuitka.net/pages/mailinglist.html>`__ in order to subscribe the
relatively low volume mailing list. All Nuitka issues can be discussed there.
Also this is the place to stay informed of what's coming.

Follow me on Twitter
--------------------

Nuitka announcements and interesting stuff is pointed to on the Twitter account,
but obviously with no details. `@KayHayen <https://twitter.com/KayHayen>`_.

I will not answer Nuitka issues via Twitter though, rather make occasional
polls, and give important announcements, as well as low level posts about
development ongoing.

Report issues or bugs
---------------------

Should you encounter any issues, bugs, or ideas, please visit the `Nuitka bug
tracker <https://github.com/kayhayen/Nuitka/issues>`__ and report them.

Best practices for reporting bugs:

- Please always include the following information in your report, for the
  underlying Python version. You can easily copy&paste this into your
  report.

  .. code-block:: sh

      python -m nuitka --version

- Try to make your example minimal. That is, try to remove code that does
  not contribute to the issue as much as possible. Ideally come up with
  a small reproducing program that illustrates the issue, using ``print``
  with different results when that programs runs compiled or native.

- If the problem occurs spuriously (i.e. not each time), try to set the
  environment variable ``PYTHONHASHSEED`` to ``0``, disabling hash
  randomization. If that makes the problem go away, try increasing in
  steps of 1 to a hash seed value that makes it happen every time, include
  it in your report.

- Do not include the created code in your report. Given proper input,
  it's redundant, and it's not likely that I will look at it without
  the ability to change the Python or Nuitka source and re-run it.

- Do not send screenshots of text, that is bad and lazy. Instead capture
  text outputs from the console.

Word of Warning
---------------

Consider using this software with caution. Even though many tests are applied
before releases, things are potentially breaking. Your feedback and patches to
Nuitka are very welcome.


Join Nuitka
===========

You are more than welcome to join Nuitka development and help to complete the
project in all minor and major ways.

The development of Nuitka occurs in git. We currently have these 3 branches:

- `master
  <http://nuitka.net/gitweb/?p=Nuitka.git;a=shortlog;h=refs/heads/master>`__:

  This branch contains the stable release to which only hotfixes for bugs will
  be done. It is supposed to work at all times and is supported.

- `develop
  <http://nuitka.net/gitweb/?p=Nuitka.git;a=shortlog;h=refs/heads/develop>`__:

  This branch contains the ongoing development. It may at times contain little
  regressions, but also new features. On this branch the integration work is
  done, whereas new features might be developed on feature branches.

- `factory
  <http://nuitka.net/gitweb/?p=Nuitka.git;a=shortlog;h=refs/heads/factory>`__:

  This branch contains unfinished and incomplete work. It is very frequently
  subject to ``git rebase`` and the public staging ground, where my work
  for develop branch lives first. It is intended for testing only and
  recommended to base any of your own development on. When updating it,
  you very often will get merge conflicts. Simply resolve those by doing
  ``git reset --hard origin/factory`` and switch to the latest version.

.. note::

   I accept requests on the social code platforms, also patch files, if they
   are good.

.. note::

   The `Developer Manual <http://nuitka.net/doc/developer-manual.html>`__
   explains the coding rules, branching model used, with feature branches and
   hotfix releases, the Nuitka design and much more. Consider reading it to
   become a contributor. This document is intended for Nuitka users.

Unsupported functionality
=========================

The ``co_code`` attribute of code objects
-----------------------------------------

The code objects are empty for for native compiled functions. There is no
bytecode with Nuitka's compiled function objects, so there is no way to provide
it.

PDB
---

There is no tracing of compiled functions to attach a debugger to.

Optimization
============

Constant Folding
----------------

The most important form of optimization is the constant folding. This is when an
operation can be fully predicted at compile time. Currently Nuitka does these
for some built-ins (but not all yet, somebody to look at this more closely will
be very welcome!), and it does it e.g. for binary/unary operations and
comparisons.

Constants currently recognized:

.. code-block:: python

    5 + 6     # binary operations
    not 7     # unary operations
    5 < 6     # comparisons
    range(3)  # built-ins

Literals are the one obvious source of constants, but also most likely other
optimization steps like constant propagation or function inlining will be. So
this one should not be underestimated and a very important step of successful
optimizations. Every option to produce a constant may impact the generated code
quality a lot.

.. admonition:: Status

   The folding of constants is considered implemented, but it might be
   incomplete in that not all possible cases are caught. Please report it as a
   bug when you find an operation in Nuitka that has only constants as input
   and is not folded.

Constant Propagation
--------------------

At the core of optimizations there is an attempt to determine values of
variables at run time and predictions of assignments. It determines if their
inputs are constants or of similar values. An expression, e.g. a module variable
access, an expensive operation, may be constant across the module of the
function scope and then there needs to be none, or no repeated module variable
look-up.

Consider e.g. the module attribute ``__name__`` which likely is only ever read,
so its value could be predicted to a constant string known at compile time. This
can then be used as input to the constant folding.

.. code-block:: python

   if __name__ == "__main__":
      # Your test code might be here
      use_something_not_use_by_program()

.. admonition:: Status

   From modules attributes, only ``__name__`` are currently actually optimized.
   Also possible would be at least ``__doc__``. In the future, this may improve
   as SSA is expanded to module variables.

Built-in Name Lookups
---------------------

Also built-in exception name references are optimized if they are used as module
level read only variables:

.. code-block:: python

   try:
      something()
   except ValueError: # The ValueError is a slow global name lookup normally.
      pass

.. admonition:: Status

   This works for all built-in names. When an assignment is done to such a
   name, or it's even local, then of course it is not done.

Built-in Call Prediction
------------------------

For built-in calls like ``type``, ``len``, or ``range`` it is often possible to
predict the result at compile time, esp. for constant inputs the resulting value
often can be precomputed by Nuitka. It can simply determine the result or the
raised exception and replace the built-in call with that value, allowing for
more constant folding or code path reduction.

.. code-block:: python

   type("string") # predictable result, builtin type str.
   len([1, 2])    # predictable result
   range(3, 9, 2) # predictable result
   range(3, 9, 0) # predictable exception, range raises due to 0.

.. admonition:: Status

   The built-in call prediction is considered implemented. We can simply during
   compile time emulate the call and use its result or raised exception. But we
   may not cover all the built-ins there are yet.

Sometimes the result of a built-in should not be predicted when the result is
big. A ``range()`` call e.g. may give too big values to include the result in
the binary. Then it is not done.

.. code-block:: python

   range( 100000 ) # We do not want this one to be expanded

.. admonition:: Status

   This is considered mostly implemented. Please file bugs for built-ins that
   are pre-computed, but should not be computed by Nuitka at compile time with
   specific values.

Conditional Statement Prediction
--------------------------------

For conditional statements, some branches may not ever be taken, because of the
conditions being possible to predict. In these cases, the branch not taken and
the condition check is removed.

This can typically predict code like this:

.. code-block:: python

   if __name__ == "__main__":
      # Your test code might be here
      use_something_not_use_by_program()

or

.. code-block:: python

   if False:
      # Your deactivated code might be here


It will also benefit from constant propagations, or enable them because once
some branches have been removed, other things may become more predictable, so
this can trigger other optimization to become possible.

Every branch removed makes optimization more likely. With some code branches
removed, access patterns may be more friendly. Imagine e.g. that a function is
only called in a removed branch. It may be possible to remove it entirely, and
that may have other consequences too.

.. admonition:: Status

   This is considered implemented, but for the maximum benefit, more constants
   need to be determined at compile time.

Exception Propagation
---------------------

For exceptions that are determined at compile time, there is an expression that
will simply do raise the exception. These can be propagated upwards, collecting
potentially "side effects", i.e. parts of expressions that were executed before
it occurred, and still have to be executed.

Consider the following code:

.. code-block:: python

   print side_effect_having() + (1 / 0)
   print something_else()

The ``(1 / 0)`` can be predicted to raise a ``ZeroDivisionError`` exception,
which will be propagated through the ``+`` operation. That part is just Constant
Propagation as normal.

The call `side_effect_having()`` will have to be retained though, but the
``print`` statement does not and can be turned into an explicit raise. The
statement sequence can then be aborted and as such the ``something_else`` call
needs no code generation or consideration anymore.

To that end, Nuitka works with a special node that raises an exception and is
wrapped with a so called "side_effects" expression, but yet can be used in code
as an expression having a value.

.. admonition:: Status

   The propagation of exceptions is mostly implemented, but needs handling in
   every kind of operations, and not all of them might do it already. As work
   progresses or examples arise, the coverage will be extended. Feel free to
   generate bug reports with non-working examples.

Exception Scope Reduction
-------------------------

Consider the following code:

.. code-block:: python

    try:
        b = 8
        print range(3, b, 0)
        print "Will not be executed"
    except ValueError, e:
        print e

The ``try`` block is bigger than it needs to be. The statement ``b = 8`` cannot
cause a ``ValueError`` to be raised. As such it can be moved to outside the try
without any risk.

.. code-block:: python

    b = 8
    try:
        print range(3, b, 0)
        print "Will not be executed"
    except ValueError as e:
        print e

.. admonition:: Status

   This is considered done. For every kind of operation, we trace if it may
   raise an exception. We do however *not* track properly yes, what can do
   a ``ValueError`` and what cannot.


Exception Block Inlining
------------------------

With the exception propagation it is then becomes possible to transform this
code:

.. code-block:: python

    try:
        b = 8
        print range(3, b, 0)
        print "Will not be executed"
    except ValueError, e:
        print e

.. code-block:: python

    try:
        raise ValueError, "range() step argument must not be zero"
    except ValueError, e:
        print e

Which then can be reduced by avoiding the raise and catch of the exception,
making it:

.. code-block:: python

   e = ValueError( "range() step argument must not be zero" )
   print e

.. admonition:: Status

   This is not implemented yet.

Empty Branch Removal
--------------------

For loops and conditional statements that contain only code without effect, it
should be possible to remove the whole construct:

.. code-block:: python

   for i in range(1000):
       pass

The loop could be removed, at maximum it should be considered an assignment of
variable ``i`` to ``999`` and no more.

.. admonition:: Status

   This is not implemented yet, as it requires us to track iterators, and their
   side effects, as well as loop values, and exit conditions. Too much yet, but
   we will get there.

Another example:

.. code-block:: python

   if side_effect_free:
      pass

The condition check should be removed in this case, as its evaluation is not
needed. It may be difficult to predict that ``side_effect_free`` has no side
effects, but many times this might be possible.

.. admonition:: Status

   This is considered implemented. The conditional statement nature is removed
   if both branches are empty, only the condition is evaluated, and checked for
   truth (in cases that could raise an exception).

Unpacking Prediction
--------------------

When the length of the right hand side of an assignment to a sequence can be
predicted, the unpacking can be replaced with multiple assignments.

.. code-block:: python

   a, b, c = 1, side_effect_free(), 3

.. code-block:: python

   a = 1
   b = side_effect_free()
   c = 3

This is of course only really safe if the left hand side cannot raise an
exception while building the assignment targets.

We do this now, but only for constants, because we currently have no ability to
predict if an expression can raise an exception or not.

.. admonition:: Status

   Not implemented yet. Will need us to see through the unpacking of what is
   an iteration over a tuple, we created ourselves. We are not there yet, but
   we will get there.

Built-in Type Inference
-----------------------

When a construct like ``in xrange()`` or ``in range()`` is used, it is possible
to know what the iteration does and represent that, so that iterator users can
use that instead.

I consider that:

.. code-block:: python

    for i in xrange(1000):
        something(i)

could translate ``xrange(1000)`` into an object of a special class that does the
integer looping more efficiently. In case ``i`` is only assigned from there,
this could be a nice case for a dedicated class.

.. admonition:: Status

   Future work, not even started.

Quicker Function Calls
----------------------

Functions are structured so that their parameter parsing and ``tp_call``
interface is separate from the actual function code. This way the call can be
optimized away. One problem is that the evaluation order can differ.

.. code-block:: python

   def f(a, b, c):
       return a, b, c

   f(c = get1(), b = get2(), a = get3())

This will have to evaluate first ``get1()``, then ``get2()`` and only then
``get3()`` and then make the function call with these values.

Therefore it will be necessary to have a staging of the parameters before making
the actual call, to avoid an re-ordering of the calls to ``get1()``, ``get2()``,
and ``get3()``.

.. admonition:: Status

   Not even started. A re-formulation that avoids the dictionary to call the
   function, and instead uses temporary variables appears to be relatively
   straight forward once we do that kind of parameter analysis.

Lowering of iterated Container Types
------------------------------------

In some cases, accesses to ``list`` constants can become ``tuple`` constants
instead.

Consider that:

.. code-block:: python

   for x in [a, b, c]:
       something(x)

Can be optimized into this:

.. code-block:: python

   for x in (a, b, c):
        something(x)

This allows for simpler, faster code to be generated, and less checks needed,
because e.g. the ``tuple`` is clearly immutable, whereas the ``list`` needs a
check to assert that. This is also possible for sets.

.. admonition:: Status

   Implemented, even works for non-constants. Needs other optimization to
   become generally useful, and will itself help other optimization to become
   possible. This allows us to e.g. only treat iteration over tuples, and not
   care about sets.

In theory something similar is also possible for ``dict``. For the later it will
be non-trivial though to maintain the order of execution without temporary
values introduced. The same thing is done for pure constants of these types,
they change to ``tuple`` values when iterated.

The order is sorted by time.

- Li Xuan Ji: Contributed patches for general portability issue and enhancements
  to the environment variable settings.

- Nicolas Dumazet: Found and fixed reference counting issues, ``import``
  packages work, improved some of the English and generally made good code
  contributions all over the place, solved code generation TODOs, did tree
  building cleanups, core stuff.

- Khalid Abu Bakr: Submitted patches for his work to support MinGW and Windows,
  debugged the issues, and helped me to get cross compile with MinGW from Linux
  to Windows. This was quite a difficult stuff.

- Liu Zhenhai: Submitted patches for Windows support, making the inline Scons
  copy actually work on Windows as well. Also reported import related bugs, and
  generally helped me make the Windows port more usable through his testing and
  information.

- Christopher Tott: Submitted patches for Windows, and general as well as
  structural cleanups.

- Pete Hunt: Submitted patches for MacOS X support.

- "ownssh": Submitted patches for built-ins module guarding, and made massive
  efforts to make high quality bug reports. Also the initial "standalone" mode
  implementation was created by him.

- Juan Carlos Paco: Submitted cleanup patches, creator of the `Nuitka GUI
  <https://github.com/juancarlospaco/nuitka-gui>`__, creator of the `Ninja IDE
  plugin <https://github.com/juancarlospaco/nuitka-ninja>`__ for Nuitka.

- "dr. Equivalent": Submitted the Nuitka Logo.

- Johan Holmberg: Submitted patch for Python3 support on MacOS X.

- Umbra: Submitted patches to make the Windows port more usable, adding user
  provided application icons, as well as MSVC support for large constants and
  console applications.

- David Cortesi: Submitted patches and test cases to make MacOS port more
  usable, specifically for the Python3 standalone support of Qt.

- Andrew Leech: Submitted github pull request to allow using "-m nuitka" to
  call the compiler. Also pull request to improve "bist_nuitka" and to do
  the registration.

Projects used by Nuitka
-----------------------

* The `CPython project <http://www.python.org>`__

  Thanks for giving us CPython, which is the base of Nuitka. We are nothing
  without it.

* The `GCC project <http://gcc.gnu.org>`__

  Thanks for not only the best compiler suite, but also thanks for supporting
  C++11 which helped to get Nuitka off the ground. Your compiler was the first
  usable for Nuitka and with little effort.

* The `Scons project <http://www.scons.org>`__

  Thanks for tackling the difficult points and providing a Python environment to
  make the build results. This is such a perfect fit to Nuitka and a dependency
  that will likely remain.

* The `valgrind project <http://valgrind.org>`__

  Luckily we can use Valgrind to determine if something is an actual improvement
  without the noise. And it's also helpful to determine what's actually
  happening when comparing.

* The `NeuroDebian project <http://neuro.debian.net>`__

  Thanks for hosting the build infrastructure that the Debian and sponsor
  Yaroslav Halchenko uses to provide packages for all Ubuntu versions.

* The `openSUSE Buildservice <http://openbuildservice.org>`__

  Thanks for hosting this excellent service that allows us to provide RPMs for a
  large variety of platforms and make them available immediately nearly at
  release time.

* The `MinGW64 project <http://mingw-w64.org>`__

  Thanks for porting the gcc to Windows. This allowed portability of Nuitka with
  relatively little effort.

* The `Buildbot project <http://buildbot.net>`__

  Thanks for creating an easy to deploy and use continuous integration framework
  that also runs on Windows and is written and configured in Python code. This
  allows to run the Nuitka tests long before release time.

* The `Redbaron project <https://github.com/PyCQA/redbaron>`__

  Thanks for creating a white space preserving and easy to use toolwork for
  refactoring Python. This has allows us to automatically format my Python
  code according to preferences and make global changes easily.

* The `isort project <http://http://timothycrosley.github.io/isort/>`__

  Thanks for making nice import ordering so easy. This makes it so easy to let
  your IDE do it and clean up afterwards.

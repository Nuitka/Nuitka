""" systimes() user and system timer implementations for use by
    pybench.

    This module implements various different strategies for measuring
    performance timings. It tries to choose the best available method
    based on the platforma and available tools.

    On Windows, it is recommended to have the Mark Hammond win32
    package installed. Alternatively, the Thomas Heller ctypes
    packages can also be used.

    On Unix systems, the standard resource module provides the highest
    resolution timings. Unfortunately, it is not available on all Unix
    platforms.

    If no supported timing methods based on process time can be found,
    the module reverts to the highest resolution wall-clock timer
    instead. The system time part will then always be 0.0.

    The module exports one public API:

    def systimes():

        Return the current timer values for measuring user and system
        time as tuple of seconds (user_time, system_time).

# Note: Please keep this module compatible to Python 1.5.2.
#
# TODOs:
#
# * Add ctypes wrapper for new clock_gettime() real-time POSIX APIs;
#   these will then provide nano-second resolution where available.
#
# * Add a function that returns the resolution of systimes()
#   values, ie. systimesres().

The source used to build Nuitka has modifications compared to normal releases:

- The benchmark programs are not included. They are not really useful and can
  be used from other sources in a better way.

- The inline copy of Scons is removed. It is not needed as the dependency on
  scons leads to an installed scons in the system. The original package uses
  the installed scons in preference, so the inline copy would (at best) only
  be dead code.

The source used to build Nuitka has modifications compared to normal releases:

- The benchmark programs are not included. They are not really useful and can
  be used from other sources in a better way.

- The inline copy of scons and appdirs are removed. It is not needed as the
  dependency on scons leads to an installed scons in the system. The
  original package uses the installed scons in preference, so the inline
  copy would (at best) only be dead code.

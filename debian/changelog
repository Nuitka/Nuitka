    example.

    these shall not be considered for this package.
  * Aligned depended version with build depended versions.

    "libpython".
  * Build depend on "python-dev-all" and "python-dbg-all" to
    execute tests with both all supported Python versions.

nuitka (0.3.18+ds-1) unstable; urgency=low

  * New upstream release.

    and so is "g++-4.5" as well.
  * Don't require the PDF generation to be successful on older
    Ubuntu versions as it crashes due to old "rst2pdf" bugs.

    standard Debian location as well.

  * Completed copyright file according to "licensecheck" findings
    and updated files accordingly. Put the included tests owned
    by upstream into public domain.
  * Use a "+ds" file as orig source with inline copy of Scons
    already removed instead of doing it as a patch.
  * Also removed the benchmark tests from "+ds" file, not useful
    to be provided with Nuitka.
  * Added syntax tests, these were omitted by mistake previously.
  * Run the test suite at package build time, it checks the basic
    tests, syntax error tests, program tests, and the compile
    itself test.

    to be able to execute the tests.
  * Corrected handling of upstream pre-release names in the watch
    file.

    for the new parts.

    as well.

    with an examples section that shows the most important uses

  * Removed foreign code for Windows generators, removed from

  * Lowered dependency for Scons to what Ubuntu Oneiric has and
    what we have as an inline copy, (scons >=2.0.1) should be

    representation.

    tree in a window.

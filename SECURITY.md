# Security Policy

## Supported Versions

There are no LTS supported versions of Nuitka, but mostly the stable version is
hot-fixed, and would be for security issues. If possible, git rebases would be
done just as they are for corruption bugs, which would then allow to use these,
but usually newer Nuitka is the expected to use version, with main always being
as bug free as possible.

| Version | Supported          |

| main    | :white_check_mark: |
| develop | :white_check_mark: |


## Reporting a Vulnerability

When you email me at `kay.hayen@gmail.com` with a well defined report, I
guarantee a reaction within 72h, and correction as soon as possible. Generally
private emails are not acceptable for questions, there I would point to GitHub,
but for sensitive information only, it's great.

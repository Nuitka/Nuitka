## Submitting a Pull Request

Pull requests are great. Here's a quick guide:

1. Fork the repo on github.
2. Install the `pre-commit` git hook

   That is going to automatically format your code as described in the
   Developer Manual. For that you have to execute this:

   python misc/install-git-hooks.py

3. Make a new branch and base your new branch on `develop`.

4. Ideally add a test specific for your change to demonstrate it. Due to Nuitka

   testing being basically to compile the whole world, it's ok to not have one.
   But obviously if you fix something, it wasn't observed by that, it would be
   good to provide a reproducer.

5. Make the tests pass.

6. Push to your fork and submit a pull request against `nuitka:develop`

7. Wait for review

   Suggestions for improvements or alternative ideas may happen. Keep in mind that
   PR checklist items can be met after the pull request has been opened by adding
   more commits to the branch.

All the submitted pieces including potential data must be compatible with the
Apache License 2, which already says that once you are sending source, e.g.
via pull request, you automatically license it as that too.

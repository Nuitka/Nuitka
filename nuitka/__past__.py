"""
Module like __future__ for things that are changed between Python2 and Python3.

These are here to provide compatible fall-backs. This is required to run the
same code easily with both CPython2 and CPython3. Sometimes, we do not care
about the actual types, or API, but would rather just check for something to
be a "in (str, unicode)" rather than making useless version checks.

"""SCons.Platform

SCons platform selection.

This looks for modules that define a callable object that can modify a
construction environment as appropriate for a given platform.

Note that we take a more simplistic view of "platform" than Python does.
We're looking for a single string that determines a set of
tool-independent variables with which to initialize a construction
environment.  Consequently, we'll examine both sys.platform and os.name
(and anything else that might come in to play) in order to return some
specification which is unique enough for our purposes.

Note that because this subsysem just *selects* a callable that can
modify a construction environment, it's possible for people to define
their own "platform specification" in an arbitrary callable function.
No one needs to use or tie in to this subsystem in order to roll
their own platform definition.

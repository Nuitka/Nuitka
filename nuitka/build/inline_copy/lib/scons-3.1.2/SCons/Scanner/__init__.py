        Construct a new scanner object given a scanner function.

        'function' - a scanner function taking two or three
        arguments and returning a list of strings.

        'name' - a name for identifying this scanner object.

        'argument' - an optional argument that, if specified, will be
        passed to both the scanner function and the path_function.

        'skeys' - an optional list argument that can be used to determine
        which scanner should be used for a given Node. In the case of File
        nodes, for example, the 'skeys' would be file suffixes.

        'path_function' - a function that takes four or five arguments
        (a construction environment, Node for the directory containing
        the SConscript file that defined the primary target, list of
        target nodes, list of source nodes, and optional argument for
        this instance) and returns a tuple of the directories that can
        be searched for implicit dependency files.  May also return a
        callable() which is called with no args and returns the tuple
        (supporting Bindable class).

        'node_class' - the class of Nodes which this scan will return.
        If node_class is None, then this scanner will not enforce any
        Node conversion and will return the raw results from the
        underlying scanner function.

        'node_factory' - the factory function to be called to translate
        the raw results returned by the scanner function into the
        expected node_class objects.

        'scan_check' - a function to be called to first check whether
        this node really needs to be scanned.

        'recursive' - specifies that this scanner should be invoked
        recursively on all of the implicit dependencies it returns
        (the canonical example being #include lines in C source files).
        May be a callable, which will be called to filter the list
        of nodes found to select a subset for recursive scanning
        (the canonical example being only recursively scanning
        subdirectories within a directory).

        The scanner function's first argument will be a Node that should
        be scanned for dependencies, the second argument will be an
        Environment object, the third argument will be the tuple of paths
        returned by the path_function, and the fourth argument will be
        the value passed into 'argument', and the returned list should
        contain the Nodes for all the direct dependencies of the file.

        Examples:

        s = Scanner(my_scanner_function)

        s = Scanner(function = my_scanner_function)

        s = Scanner(function = my_scanner_function, argument = 'foo')

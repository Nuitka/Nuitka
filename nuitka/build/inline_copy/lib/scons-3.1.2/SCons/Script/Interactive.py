# TODO:
#
# This has the potential to grow into something with a really big life
# of its own, which might or might not be a good thing.  Nevertheless,
# here are some enhancements that will probably be requested some day
# and are worth keeping in mind (assuming this takes off):
# 
# - A command to re-read / re-load the SConscript files.  This may
#   involve allowing people to specify command-line options (e.g. -f,
#   -I, --no-site-dir) that affect how the SConscript files are read.
#
# - Additional command-line options on the "build" command.
#
#   Of the supported options that seemed to make sense (after a quick
#   pass through the list), the ones that seemed likely enough to be
#   used are listed in the man page and have explicit test scripts.
#
#   These had code changed in Script/Main.py to support them, but didn't
#   seem likely to be used regularly, so had no test scripts added:
#
#       build --diskcheck=*
#       build --implicit-cache=*
#       build --implicit-deps-changed=*
#       build --implicit-deps-unchanged=*
#
#   These look like they should "just work" with no changes to the
#   existing code, but like those above, look unlikely to be used and
#   therefore had no test scripts added:
#
#       build --random
#
#   These I'm not sure about.  They might be useful for individual
#   "build" commands, and may even work, but they seem unlikely enough
#   that we'll wait until they're requested before spending any time on
#   writing test scripts for them, or investigating whether they work.
#
#       build -q [???  is there a useful analog to the exit status?]
#       build --duplicate=
#       build --profile=
#       build --max-drift=
#       build --warn=*
#       build --Y
#
# - Most of the SCons command-line options that the "build" command
#   supports should be settable as default options that apply to all
#   subsequent "build" commands.  Maybe a "set {option}" command that
#   maps to "SetOption('{option}')".
#
# - Need something in the 'help' command that prints the -h output.
#
# - A command to run the configure subsystem separately (must see how
#   this interacts with the new automake model).
#
# - Command-line completion of target names; maybe even of SCons options?
#   Completion is something that's supported by the Python cmd module,
#   so this should be doable without too much trouble.

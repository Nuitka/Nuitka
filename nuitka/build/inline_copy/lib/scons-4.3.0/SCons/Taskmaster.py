"""Generic Taskmaster module for the SCons build engine.

This module contains the primary interface(s) between a wrapping user
interface and the SCons build engine.  There are two key classes here:

Taskmaster
    This is the main engine for walking the dependency graph and
    calling things to decide what does or doesn't need to be built.

Task
    This is the base class for allowing a wrapping interface to
    decide what does or doesn't actually need to be done.  The
    intention is for a wrapping interface to subclass this as
    appropriate for different types of behavior it may need.

    The canonical example is the SCons native Python interface,
    which has Task subclasses that handle its specific behavior,
    like printing "'foo' is up to date" when a top-level target
    doesn't need to be built, and handling the -c option by removing
    targets as its "build" action.  There is also a separate subclass
    for suppressing this output when the -q option is used.

    The Taskmaster instantiates a Task object for each (set of)
    target(s) that it decides need to be evaluated and/or built.

        Validate the content of the pending_children set. Assert if an

        This function is used strictly for debugging the taskmaster by
        checking that no invariants are violated. It is not used in
        normal operation.

        The pending_children set is used to detect cycles in the
        dependency graph. We call a "pending child" a child that is
        found in the "pending" state when checking the dependencies of
        its parent node.

        A pending child can occur when the Taskmaster completes a loop
        through a cycle. For example, let's imagine a graph made of
        three nodes (A, B and C) making a cycle. The evaluation starts
        at node A. The Taskmaster first considers whether node A's
        child B is up-to-date. Then, recursively, node B needs to
        check whether node C is up-to-date. This leaves us with a
        dependency graph looking like::

                                          Next candidate \
                                                          \
            Node A (Pending) --> Node B(Pending) --> Node C (NoState)
                    ^                                     |
                    |                                     |
                    +-------------------------------------+

        Now, when the Taskmaster examines the Node C's child Node A,
        it finds that Node A is in the "pending" state. Therefore,
        Node A is a pending child of node C.

        Pending children indicate that the Taskmaster has potentially
        loop back through a cycle. We say potentially because it could
        also occur when a DAG is evaluated in parallel. For example,
        consider the following graph::

            Node A (Pending) --> Node B(Pending) --> Node C (Pending) --> ...
                    |                                     ^
                    |                                     |
                    +----------> Node D (NoState) --------+
                                      /
                      Next candidate /

        The Taskmaster first evaluates the nodes A, B, and C and
        starts building some children of node C. Assuming, that the
        maximum parallel level has not been reached, the Taskmaster
        will examine Node D. It will find that Node C is a pending
        child of Node D.

        In summary, evaluating a graph with a cycle will always
        involve a pending child at one point. A pending child might
        indicate either a cycle or a diamond-shaped DAG. Only a
        fraction of the nodes ends-up being a "pending child" of
        another node. This keeps the pending_children set small in
        practice.

        We can differentiate between the two cases if we wait until
        the end of the build. At this point, all the pending children
        nodes due to a diamond-shaped DAG will have been properly
        built (or will have failed to build). But, the pending
        children involved in a cycle will still be in the pending
        state.

        The taskmaster removes nodes from the pending_children set as
        soon as a pending_children node moves out of the pending
        state. This also helps to keep the pending_children set small.

        (both the target Node itself and its sources, which are always

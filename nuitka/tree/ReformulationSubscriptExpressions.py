""" Reformulation of subscript into slicing.

For Python2, there is a difference between x[a], x[a:b], x[a:b:c] whereas
Python3 treats the later by making a slice object, Python2 tries to have
special slice access, if available, or building a slice object only at the
end.

Consult the Developer Manual for information. TODO: Add ability to sync
source code comments with Developer Manual sections.

    This is a plug-in to make programs work well in standalone mode which are using tkinter.
    These programs require the presence of certain libraries written in the TCL language.
    On Windows platforms, the existence of these libraries cannot be assumed. We therefore

    1. Copy the TCL libraries as sub-folders to the program's dist folder
    2. Redirect the program's tkinter requests to these library copies. This is
       done by setting appropriate variables in the os.environ dictionary.
       Tkinter will use these variable value to locate the library locations.

    Each time before the program issues an import to a tkinter module, we make
    sure, that the TCL environment variables are correctly set.

""" Outputs to the user.

Printing with intends or plain, mostly a compensation for the print strangeness.

We want to avoid "from __future__ import print_function" in every file out
there, which makes adding another debug print rather tedious. This should
cover all calls/uses of "print" we have to do, and the make it easy to simply
to "print for_debug" without much hassle (braces).

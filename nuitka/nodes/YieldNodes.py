""" Yield node.

The yield node returns to the caller of the generator and therefore may execute
absolutely arbitrary code, from the point of view of this code. It then returns
something, which may often be 'None', but doesn't have to be.

TODO: Often it will be used as a statement, which may also be reflected in a
dedicated node to save a bit of memory.

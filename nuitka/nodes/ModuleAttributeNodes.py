""" Module/Package attribute nodes

The represent special values of the modules. The "__name__", "__package__",
"__file__", and "__spec__" values can all be highly dynamic and version
dependent

These nodes are intended to allow for as much compile time optimization as
possible, despite this difficulty. In some modes these node become constants
quickly, in others they will present boundaries for optimization.

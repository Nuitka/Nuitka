""" Assignment related nodes.

The most simple assignment statement ``a = b`` is what we have here. All others
are either re-formulated using temporary variables, e.g. ``a, b = c`` or are
attribute, slice, subscript assignments.

The deletion is a separate node unlike in CPython where assigning to ``NULL`` is
internally what deletion is. But deleting is something entirely different to us
during code generation, which is why we keep them separate.

Tracing assignments in SSA form is the core of optimization for which we use
the traces.

""" Access to standard library distinction.

For code to be in the standard library means that it's not written by the
user for sure. We treat code differently based on that information, by e.g.
including as byte code.

To determine if a module from the standard library, we can abuse the attribute
"__file__" of the "os" module like it's done in "isStandardLibraryPath" of this
module.

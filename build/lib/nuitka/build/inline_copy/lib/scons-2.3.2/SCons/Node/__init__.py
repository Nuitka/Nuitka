"""SCons.Node

The Node package for the SCons software construction utility.

This is, in many ways, the heart of SCons.

A Node is where we encapsulate all of the dependency information about
any thing that SCons can build, or about any thing which SCons can use
to build some other thing.  The canonical "thing," of course, is a file,
but a Node can also represent something remote (like a web page) or
something completely abstract (like an Alias).

Each specific type of "thing" is specifically represented by a subclass
of the Node base class:  Node.FS.File for files, Node.Alias for aliases,
etc.  Dependency information is kept here in the base class, and
information specific to files/aliases/etc. is in the subclass.  The
goal, if we've done this correctly, is that any type of "thing" should
be able to depend on any other type of "thing."

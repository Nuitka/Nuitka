# Bug Report

**IMPORTANT: Please review the
[Issue Guidelines](https://github.com/Nuitka/Nuitka/blob/develop/CONTRIBUTING.md#submitting-an-issue)
before submitting.**

______________________________________________________________________

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Pre-Submission Checklist

*Please check these items before submitting your report. This text can be removed.*

- [ ] **Search Existing Issues:** Has this bug already been reported or fixed? Sometimes reports you
  find are bad, always feel free to make a better one, but reference what you found.
- [ ] **Python vs. Nuitka:** Does the issue occur when running the code with standard Python? If
  yes, it's not a Nuitka-specific issue, do not report it.
- [ ] **Test `develop` Branch:** Have you tried the `develop` version of Nuitka? It might contain a
  fix. Get it here https://nuitka.net/doc/download.html

## üêõ Bug Description

*(A clear and concise description of what the bug is.)*

## üñ•Ô∏è Environment

### 1. Nuitka Version, Python Version, OS, and Platform

**Provide the full output** of this command (replace `python` with your specific interpreter if
needed, e.g. `python_t`, for free-threading or `python_d` for debug Python):

```sh
python -m nuitka --version
```

*(Issues without this full output will be considered `invalid` as it contains crucial information
always required for diagnosis.)*

### 2. How Nuitka and Python were Installed

*(e.g., pip, anaconda, deb, rpm, from source, git clone, virtualenv used?)*

### 3. Relevant PyPI Packages and Versions

If specific packages are involved (e.g., `numpy`), list their names and versions. Shorten the output
of `python -m pip list -v` to only include relevant packages, but in doubt a longer list is not
necessarily harmful.

```sh
python -m pip list -v
```

## üõ†Ô∏è To Reproduce

### 1. "Hello World" Test (if applicable)

If you suspect a setup issue, first try compiling a simple `print("hello world")` program. If that
fails, report that error instead. *(We don't want a "Tensorflow does not work" report if basic
compilation fails. Please also consult the User Manual for supported setups.)*

### 2. Short, Self-Contained, Correct, Eligible (SSCCE) Example

Provide a minimal code example that reproduces the issue. It should have as few external
dependencies as possible. *(Issues without a clear, runnable example are likely to be rejected. For
packaging issues, a simple import might suffice. Repositories with `pipenv` or archives with small
examples are very welcome, but must contain only source code. Ensure usage is obvious; a compile
script is ideal. For non-commercial users, keep the code brief.)*

```python
# Your SSCCE code here
```

### 3. Nuitka Command Line Options

State the Nuitka options used. Ideally, use `# nuitka-project:` options in your code.

```python
# nuitka-project: --your-option=value
# nuitka-project: --another-option
```

Or, list the command line:

```sh
# Your Nuitka command here
# e.g., python -m nuitka --standalone your_script.py
```

**Important Notes on Options:**

- **Avoid all unnecessary options:**
  - Do **not** use `--deployment`. It disables bug-catching features. Remove it if you encounter an
    issue.
  - If the issue occurs with `--mode=standalone`, do not report it with `--mode=onefile` unless the
    problem is specific to onefile. State if the issue also occurs in standalone mode if you report
    a onefile issue.
  - Minimize options used. Do not use `--quiet` or disable warnings.

## üìâ Expected Behavior

*(A clear and concise description of what you expected to happen.)*

## üìÑ Actual Behavior & Output

*(What actually happened? Include any error messages, tracebacks, or relevant logs. Use code blocks
for long outputs (triple backticks).*

## ‚Ü©Ô∏è Regression (if applicable)

Did this work in a previous version of Nuitka? If so, *please* specify the last known working
version. *(This helps dramatically in isolating the issue, e.g., via `git bisect`.)*

## üí° Additional Context (Optional)

*(Add any other context about the problem here.)*

______________________________________________________________________

## üö´ Unwelcome Practices (Please Read)

- **No Screenshots of Text:** Do *not* post screenshots of code, errors, or console output unless
  absolutely necessary (e.g., a GUI display problem). Provide text directly so it's searchable and
  copyable. Reports without proper text are likely to be rejected.
- **Do Not Close Issues Yourself:** We will close issues once they are resolved in a stable release.
  If you find your issue is invalid, you may close it, and we will tag it as `invalid` or even
  delete it later.
- **Do Not Report Against `factory` Branch:** Unless specifically asked, avoid reporting issues
  found on the `factory` branch as it's often unstable. Discuss on Discord first.

## üíº Commercial Support

Consider Nuitka commercial support for priority assistance, which also helps sustain Nuitka's
development. This allows for direct code sharing or paid time for issue resolution in your
environment.

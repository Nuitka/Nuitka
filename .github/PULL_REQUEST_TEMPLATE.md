### What does this PR do?

### Why was it initiated? Any relevant Issues?

### PR Checklist
- [ ] Correct base branch selected? `develop` for new features and bug fixes too. If it's
      part of a hotfix, it will be moved to ``master`` during it.
- [ ] All tests still pass. Check the developer manual about ``Running the Tests``. There
      are Travis tests that cover the most important things however, and you are
      welcome to rely on those, but they might not cover enough.
- [ ] Ideally new features or fixed regressions ought to be covered via new tests.
- [ ] Ideally new or changed features have documentation updates.
